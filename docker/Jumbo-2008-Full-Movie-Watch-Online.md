Place an item like a silk scarf or a sponge ball or a bunch of playing cards in the bag. 
Instantly turn the bag inside out to show that **the item has vanished!** 
The item can then be made to reappear instantly if desired.

Use this bag to produce prizes or candy. Show the bag empty, then pull the prizes out of the bag.
Use this bag as a name-drawing bag for a contest. Add some comedy by letting spectators place their entries into the bag, then make the switch, dumping out confetti or candy, etc. Then make the switch back to draw the name from the bag.
What can you produce from the "empty" bag? How about the **Huge 5 1/2 Foot Production Silk**? Or a **Happy Birthday Silk**? Or even a set of **Sponge Rabbits**?
 
When you produce your silks, you want them to "pop" up out of the production box or change bag like a Kleenex, so you can grab the next one easily, quickly and smoothly.
**Here is a FREE lesson** to teach you Monticup's personal technique for correctly loading your silks so that it works every time!
 
I believe I have successfully migrated one of our Maestro environments from R80.20SP to R81.10. Now I've run into a problem when I attempted to install the latest Jumbo (at the time Take 22). The upgrade of the Orchestrators was not an issue, but it was during the upgrade of our security group that I ran into problems.

First, I downloaded the latest update and transferred it over to the security group and imported it. I then removed one member from the cluster. It was on that member that I installed Take 22. Upon a reboot, it never came Active again. It stayed in the Down state for hours. I even did a reboot of the member and it still would come back online in the Down state. I uninstalled the hotfix and returned the security group back to what it was before trying to install Take 22 on that member. The member came back up after the reboot and showed all members Active again.
 
Just curious if anyone else had attempted to update to a newer Take on their upgraded R81.10 Maestro environment and seen any issues or for that matter no issues. I see that Take 30 is now out, but I didn't see anything in it that lead me to believe it would make a difference. I should have captured what cphaprob -state showed after the upgrade on the one member, but I forgot to. If it makes a difference, I chose the member of the security group that was not the SMO. Again, shouldn't make a difference as in the past with R80.20SP I would always start with the non-SMO member when updating takes without any issue.
 
cphaprob list would have been helpful to check why it was in down state.
Did you try to perform cpstop on the other SGMs to check if the upgraded SGM turns active?
What do you mean by "removed one member from the cluster"? You performed a cpstop?
 
So basically, I'm following the normal Maestro instructions on how to install a jumbo hotfix on a security group. Since their are only two members in the group I begin patching with member 2, and when it is done and both members show Active I move on to doing member 1. This is the first time I'm putting a jumbo hotfix on a newly updated R81.10 Maestro environment. So the hotfix was finished installing and it rebooted member 2. When it came back up, member 2 stayed in a Down state. I'll have to run an update again to see if I can capture the cphaprob state if it fails again. It had to do with something about it not being able to communicate or sync with the other member.
 
My Maestro environment is **already** upgrade to R81.10. My problem occurred when I began the process of installing R81.10 Jumbo Take 22 on these newly upgraded machines, specifically the security gateways as I had no problem installing the jumbo on the MHO devices. Apologies if I didn't make that clear.
 
I had not worked with Maestro but did something similar recently on regular Quantum Security gateways running r81.10 on a HA Cluster XL. What i did is checked that clusters showed active>standby with cphaprob stat then did a clusterXL\_admin down on Active member. After that downloaded the JHT via Web (Gaia) with CPUSU thing > run verifier after downloaded and then installed. After successfully installation and reboot i waited 15 minutes and then upgraded the active member the same way via WEB and after waiting 15 minutes ran clusterXL\_admin up and check sync again. I did not experienced any downtime.

Just recently I purchased a Rolex yacht master watch from Swiss Watch Expo with the help from Ro Wright sales agent with the above company. The transaction went smoothly, delivery went great, and the customer service after I received the watch was even better. I would do business again with Swiss Watch Expo and also with Ro. Overall it was a good experience. Thanks, Ro for the help. Rick Ratcliffe
 
The process of picking and purchasing a watch was incredibly easy. I actually had to return it and swapped out for another watch. They made the whole process extremely easy and I will definitely be returning in the future for additional watch purchases.
 
Experience with SwissWatchExpo was excellent. Vlad was awesome and great experience with the rest of the team. The watch is exceptional and the price was great. Will return when ready to upgrade or add another to my collection.

I purchased a watch for my husband's 50th birthday. It is always a little scary trying to purchase something this expensive online, however they made me feel completely comfortable with the entire process. We did a video chat before the purchase. I was able to see their showroom and meet the employees as well as s
