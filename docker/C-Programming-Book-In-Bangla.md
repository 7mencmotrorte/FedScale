Learning programming can be a challenging endeavour, often requiring a solid understanding of complex concepts and syntax. For enthusiastic learners, the initial hurdles can be especially overwhelming. However, there is a solution: toy programming languages - the training wheels of coding that can simplify fundamental concepts so beginners can grasp them more easily.
 
For a new learner, a toy programming language can be a great tool to help build confidence and experiment with coding ideas. Even then, for a beginner, programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and C++ might deter them as they are very different from traditional languages. Thus, comes Mama Lang, a Bangla-based toy programming language intended to be an easy entryway to coding for Bangla speakers.

"I would describe 'Mama Lang' as a fun, unique, and esoteric programming language deeply rooted in the cultural context of Dhaka, Bangladesh," says Ahnaf Prio, creator of Mama Lang, who explains that 'Mama Lang' is derived from the Bangla word 'mama', a blanket term of amiable association in casual Bangla conversations.
 
Ahnaf was inspired to write a Bangla-based toy programming language after seeing 'Bhai Lang', a Typescript-based toy programming language based on the Hindi word 'bhai', made by two Indian engineers. Ahnaf opted to base Mama Lang on JavaScript, which he feels will help beginners get into coding more easily as JavaScript is currently the most common programming language in the world. "Mama Lang will help people open up to the JavaScript language and other JavaScript projects and jobs," Ahnaf adds.

"Mama Lang is designed not just as a programming language, but as a cultural expression and a playful tool for both beginners and experienced programmers," says Ahnaf. Mama Lang is a JavaScript-based esoteric language, where .mama files are converted to .js and executed using Node.js. As such, anything you can write in JavaScript can be written using Mama Lang as well.
 
Ahnaf explains that Mama Lang features familiar programming constructs like variables, types, built-ins for output, conditionals, and loops, but with a "distinct local twist". For example, variables are declared using 'mama aida hoilo', and the boolean values are 'haw mama (yes)' and 'nah mama (no)'. This essentially means that instead of learning complex terms associated with programming, a native Bangla speaker can use these everyday conversational terms to execute their codes.
 
When asked about the potential impact of a Bangla-based programming language, Ahnaf says, "The playful syntax of Mama Lang, inspired by everyday conversations in Dhaka, invites users to engage with programming in a more relaxed and enjoyable way which I think most of us Bangalis don't get exposed to."
 
Ahnaf, a graduate of Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, shares that he didn't know how to write code until his sophomore year. Initially, he had found it very difficult to get into programming but soon grew an interest in it after seeing how most of his peers had experience with programming since high school. "Most of them were learning new languages with me, but they already knew how variables are defined, how logic works, and what a boolean is."
 
Relating his initial hurdle of getting into programming, Ahnaf feels that a toy programming language based on a casual Bangla word will help Banglalis learn these key concepts in a more light-hearted way. "As a beginner, I didn't find coding fun - but I enjoy it a lot now. I hope Mama Lang can help other Bangalis get over the same hurdles I had."
 
When talking about other Bangladeshi programming languages, Ahnaf mentioned 'Chascript', which, according to its GitHub page, is a Bangla scripting language built with ECMAScript grammar and parsed using JISON JavaScript. "If anything, I would support Chascript over my creation, or even the creation of a new programming language written in Bangla." Mama Lang is an open-source community project, and anyone can contribute to it.
 
Ahnaf currently has his own software consulting company named Halicon where he consults Fortune 500 companies in Minnesota. He is also involved as a software architecture consultant at BestBuy, a multinational consumer electronics retailer. He previously co-founded a restaurant marketing startup called Tavolo in Minnesota and currently has a life insurance startup called Invive.
 
One says learn it, another says learn it. Some say that learning Python, some say learning PHP, some say learning C will be basic, while listening to JavaScript or how much can be done. Those who say they don't say bad, just say what feels good in their own experience.
 
So someone asked me to suggest some channels. I have subscribed to so many places that the real channels are hard to find. After a lot of fussing, I came up with some channels that will not feel boring at least.
 
Many channels have escaped my notice, and many channels have dropped out because of the discussion about income or outsourcing (although the name of the thing is supposed to be freelancing) instead of teaching.
 
Also, a few channels are a bit out of programming but I think it needs to be on the list, so I kept it. I have tried to keep those who have published new videos in at least 1-2 months. Even if newcomers learn programming videos from 3-4 years ago, they will have to face many problems.
 
His content is popular on many topics including education, programming, love, romance, web design, career, Google, Facebook. He has also written several remarkable books, including Recharge Your Down Battery, Paracetamol of Paramoy Life, Fourteen Groups of Programming, Programming for Hubbles.
 
His channel has a lot of videos about algorithms and data structures, topics that the rest usually discuss a little less. You will see him create courses on many topics, including "Introduction to Python", "Chalk in hand in programming".
 
He has written many books, including "Programming Essentials - Python 3", "Coding Interviews: Preparation, Problems and Solutions", "The Wonder World of Programming", which can be found on Rokmari's website .
 
He has written books on many topics like Python, Psy Kit, Deep Learning, etc., along with numerous video tutorials. Those of you who are interested in studying machine learning should not miss this channel.
 
You can understand by listening to him that he spends a lot of time for each video. Each video is very informative and professional. It's like watching a presentation and subscribing to the channel. There are many nice videos on WordPress customization, themes and plugins will come in handy for development.
 
The inaugural edition of Click in Bangla will air on Saturday, 6 January, on Channel i in Bangladesh. It will later be available on the BBC News Bangla website bbc.com/bangla and YouTube channel. BBC Probaho will now air on Mondays and Thursdays, with the first new-look programme to be broadcast on Monday, 8 January.
 
The twice-weekly BBC Probaho will be broadcast from a studio incorporating new branding which now features across all BBC News Bangla platforms.

BBC News Bangla is part of the BBC World Service. The expansion of the BBC Bangla TV offer is part of the major enhancement which is underway across the BBC World Service, funded through a 291m grant from the UK Government.
 
VS Code detects the operating system's UI language and prompts you to install the appropriate Language Pack, if available on the Marketplace. Below is an example recommending a Simplified Chinese Language Pack:
 
**Note**: This article explains how to change the display language in the VS Code UI via Language Packs such as French or Chinese. If you want to add programming language support, for example for C++ or Java, refer to the Programming Languages section of the documentation.
 
**Note**: You must have the appropriate Language Pack installed for the language you specify with the command-line switch. If the matching Language Pack is not installed, VS Code will display English.
 
This notification may mean that your argv.json file wasn't saved after a previous change. Check if there are any errors in the file (**Preferences: Configure Runtime Arguments**), make sure the file is saved, and try to install the Language Pack again.
 
Lifeline programming is part of the broader work that humanitarian agencies refer to as 'Communicating with Communities' (CwC). It centres around ensuring good dialogue between humanitarian responders and people who are affected by crisis. CwC projects also establish ways that survivors can get the information they need and that their voices are heard by humanitarian actors.
