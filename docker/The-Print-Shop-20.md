I want to print simple business cards and I have my design ready in PDF format which I made with Adobe InDesign, but one printing service is asking me for the original file, along with all the fonts and images I used for my design.

I understand that if I give them my master file, they can claim ownership of it and use it as their own. Should I give them my editable file? Do they really need it to for print? Why are they asking for it?
 
I've worked in the PrePress department of several print shops. More often than not, hi-res pdfs with printer's marks were all we needed, but there were times that we asked for the native files so that if there were any last minute changes needed, we could make them without having to go back to the designer. These changes were typically simple ones, i.e. if black needed to be rich black, or if a spot color needed to be changed to CMYK. Or, if the client requested a minor text change last-minute, we could do it and not significantly slow down the workflow. Any design/text changes more than the minimum would be sent back to the designer, however.
 
That said, if you do provide the native files to the printer, I'd think there is very little chance you'd have to worry about them stealing your work. They have a reputation to uphold as a business; You will also still retain a copy of the native files as well, so any possible claim they might try to make later could easily be disputed. I just don't see that happening, although nothing's impossible. But overall, I'd say that's not something to be concerned with.
 
Sometimes prepress needs your editable "source" file or "live" file to adjust/repair things for output. It is common for prepress to ask for those files. PDFs are often good enough, but sometimes not, and more difficult to work with than source files.
 
It is standard ethics to protect the property of clients, to abide by privacy and discretion, to treat files as you would want them to be treated of they were your own. Like I said, if you don't trust your print provider, there's plenty more of them fish in the sea.

But if they insist, I usually limit the possible editing and for reuse without permits. If your page has layered PSD, just flatten/merge them. The text should be outlined. Crop any extra image outside the page, complex vector shapes must be merged, etc. I know even just a PDF file can be modified, the image can be extracted, the vectors can be copied and edited, etc., but at least we limit the even wilder possibility. It takes an extra work, but worth it.
 
Like the Annapolis campus bookstore, the Print Shop is an auxiliary part of the college, and is audited every July. Therefore it charges for all its services; the intention and goal is a break-even operation. All faculty and campus offices have annual budgets. Student organizations have funds distributed to them through the DC. Some student publications, such as The Gadfly and Energeia, have money budgeted to them through the college.
 
The large copier features on-line stream punching as copy prints for binding later-speeding up the coil binding process for lab manuals and other instructional materials. Two interchangeable dies are available for three-hole punching and plastic coil binding (11-inch side only).
 
Faculty pickup and delivery of work available daily. Staff may call for pickup and delivery of work at no charge, of course. Jobs may be sent by campus mail if it is not urgent. Walk-ins and copy-while-you-wait jobs are quite welcome, too.
 
Inter-office pick-ups, faculty, student and staff P.O. Boxes are all serviced by the mailroom staff and its student aides. All outgoing office mail picked up by the mailroom staff is the responsibility of the mailroom, and it is processed twice daily. Mail picked up at the post office is also distributed by the mailroom only.
 
However, when the US Postal Service (USPS) began automating and offering discounts to educational institutions, they strongly recommended that if there is an in-plant print shop that it combine automated mail processing equipment with their printing operation. With this combination of printing/mailing, we quite often print, for example, a postcard, then process a mailing list through the USPS database, address the mail piece, meter it, and mail it the same day.
 
In 1996, the Print Shop bought its first Neopost addressing machine, computer and mail list processing programs and computer to, using the USPS database. A new computerized metering machine was installed to process first class and automated pre-sort first class mail.
 
**What all that means for you is this: if a work is in fact 100% in the public domain, and you obtained it from a public domain source, then it is in fact legal to print, sell, or do whatever you would like with the work.**
 
To be 100% certain, always be sure to carefully read any information on the website where you are obtaining your images from to ensure that they have the rights to be sharing the images and have not set any limitations on your use of them (ie can be used for personal or educational use only). In addition, things that are Public Domain in the United States, may not be in other countries, so just do your research.
 
While I will admit that most of these services do in fact put in many many hours of hard work to sources these images, digitally update them for optimal printing, crop them to better fit various common size format needs for our modern day audiences, or even go as far as altering them to remove details they find distracting, and yes, while all that hard work is valuable, it still does not change the fact that they are not the original authors of the work they are selling and are choosing not to credit the original artist in any way.
 
**The Print Shop** is a desktop publishing software package originally published in 1984 by Broderbund. It was unique in that it provided libraries of clip art and templates through a simple interface to build signs, posters and banners with household dot-matrix printers.[1] Over the years, the software has been updated to accommodate changing file formats and printer technologies.
 
The original version was for the Apple II and created signs, cards, banners, and letterheads.[1] Designed by David Balsam and programmed by Martin Kahn, it became one of the most popular Apple II titles of all time. Versions for MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and the Atari 8-bit computers followed, as did a variant for the Apple IIGS.
 
The Print Shop was very successful. In 1985, it and *Ghostbusters* were reportedly the two most widely pirated Commodore 64 programs.[2] *II Computing* listed it seventh on the magazine's list of top Apple II non-game, non-educational software as of late 1985, based on sales and market-share data.[3] In 1988, Broderbund announced that the company had sold more than one million copies, and that sales of the software comprised 4% of the entire United States software market in 1987.[4] In April 1989, it was awarded a "Diamond" certification from the Software Publishers Association for sales above 500,000 units.[5] The series comprised 29% of Broderbund revenue in fiscal year 1992.[6]
 
*Ahoy!*'s reviewer called the Commodore 64 version of The Print Shop "one of the best thought out, easiest to use packages I've come across", reporting that he did not need to use the manual to produce his first greeting cards. He predicted that the software "is destined to become one of the most popular packages for the Commodore 64".[7] *II Computing* criticized the Apple II version's inflexible layout options and lack of print preview, but concluded that it "is truly 'a graphics utility for the rest of us', encouraging creativity and self-expression ... you'll want to use this program over and over again".[8]
 
**The Print Shop Companion**, developed by Roland Gustafsson and released in 1985, added a calendar feature, an updated graphic editor, font and border editors, and a "Creature Maker" game, as well as an expanded library of fonts, borders, and graphics. Initially, to use the new fonts and borders in The Print Shop Companion had to modify the original program; subsequent releases of The Print Shop included built-in support for Companion.
 
In 1986, the first Apple Macintosh version was released. It featured graphics by Marney Morris and was the most powerful version available at the time. It was popular in schools and contained a unique feature with which graphics could be transferred to or from a MacPaint file.
 
Graphics libraries for The Print Shop came from Broderbund and other vendors.[8][9] Libraries were produced for the original version and continued to be rolled out as late as the 1990s. User-produced graphics were also commonly distributed by various user groups, and even submitted to disk magazines, such as the *Softdisk* family of magazines.
 
**The New Print Shop** came out in 1988 for Apple II and MS-DOS, and improved on the original.[10] **Print Shop Deluxe**, for Mac, MS-DOS, and Windows, followed in 1993. Deluxe used a new all-graphical interface still found in Print Shop programs today and allowed for the creation of calendars. **Print Shop Deluxe Companion** added new modules and graphics, and the **Ensemble** version combined The Print Shop, the Companion, and several graphics libraries on one CD.
