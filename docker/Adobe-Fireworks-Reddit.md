I have a subscription that includes Fireworks CS6 but I am no longer able to use it. When I install it, it simple says that the trial period is expired. When I go to sign in, it asks for a serial number. Looking at help topics to install Muse (didn't work, I don't have this), reset the hosts (nothing there) and use the Creative Cloud Cleaner (ran it, didn't work), uninstall and reinstall (yep tried twice), and getting nowhere. Also I am constantly getting an Error 500: Internal Server Error (on multiple browsers and both behind and not behind my VPN and after clearing cache) when I try to access apps in my subscription. What has happened? Please assist.
 
In fact, you don't have to go that far... it's still tedious, but you just have to enter your serial numbers and identify yourself again... and again... and again.... let's say every time the computer reboots, it's usually necessary to show your good faith.

So when the trial period dialog box opens, you need to click on the button, I have a serial number, or validate your purchase... then there'll be a button, I have a serial number (a second time)... you'll then be invited to log in, and some
 
No - when you get to the end of trial and click to licence it and login to creative cloud its still not accessible. They have stopped allowing us to access it. I have tried all ways round. It is still showing in creative cloud but when opened it gives the trial screen - and no option to buy, just add serial number - which we dont have.
 
No, we get what this user gets - it doesnt let us use it without entering the serial number we dont have. 

Ive used fireworks for over a decade without one as part of my suite - in older apps. 

Is there a work around.
 
As you, I'm also using a Creative Suite version of Fw, and activation on the Creative Cloud works just fine, but I can't remember whether or not I had to enter the serial numbers supplied with the CD at the time.
 
As far as I can see if you keep paying you will be fine - if you ever stop or need a new payment plan (mine stopped as they switched over my payment after I complained about the high rate) - then you wont be able to access it again. So unless there are pirated serial numbers to buy there dont seem to be any work arounds anymore. For ages we just had to access older apps
 
I was hoping to have the same luck as you but wow did I get a winner with the tech support. They asked me to see if I could install it (confirmed I did), redirected me to here (which I said I had a thread), asked me AGAIN if I could install it. Remarakble run around. Did you say anything specific that might help me get them to provide me with something similar. Literally showed them photos of my issue and they just sent me back here. Absolutely useless tech support. What's even the point? Infuriating.
 
I hear your pain.
I didnt have to tell them anything specific. I guess its a matter or luck who you land up getting? So maybe try again. It did take them a while to verify me and the issue, but once i told them the serials i have (from the page on the site) do not work, they quickly provided me with another few to try until one worked.
Good luck!

Got it yeah I couldn't get past the "Yes it's installed, yes I have access to it, yes I opened a thread in the community" it was like talking to a robot. I'm guessing the script only has those two options. Luck of the draw indeed. I was so infuriated from it I basically just booted up Photoshop and figured out the things I used FW for I can do in PS (albeit clunkily with some fumbling) so I think I'm just resolved to using PS.
 
Im annoyed by this as I asked them for that as a work around - give me a serial number - having used fireworks within creative cloud for years until my plan cancelled and set up again April 14th - and they said it wasnt possible.
 
Funnily enough they (Adobe Live Chat) are using this - cleaner tool - to say 'well we did say if you did that fireworks may then no longer work. I have chat history and screen shots. They want it killing off. Any suggestions for work arounds for the pop up asking for serial number let us know.
 
Sounds like you ran into the same issues that I had. I decided it wasn't worth the effort anymore and been using PS. Two months later I don't regret it, was losing too much patience trying to get anywhere. Would have loved to see more success stories but that doesn't seem to be the case.
 
I almost yelled at the adobe person who gave me a link to this forum. And made out he couldnt work out what I was saying - as if a unique issue - and yet so many of us are saying exactly what you have said. 

So now I open it and click License this I get the message 'To use Adobe services, please update your Adobe applications, operating system, and browser to the latest versions.' ?? This is new. And I havent done anything with my laptops - both are suddenly saying this. 

t should just let me login to create cloud and use it. Whhy they are working so hard to remove fireworks is mind boggling. Its the only app I use and so Ive been paying a monthly fee for a decade for that one app. 

There must be a work around. Id even use the trial for 30 days and keep doing that if I had to. But no point paying for creative cloud if it was the only app I used. Are they really that wealthy they just dont want our money.
 
I have a quick and easy solution to this problem, but first I need to say that I am extremely frustrated with Adobe, I pay for my subscription and I want the right to use fireworks cs6, I'm sorry, but I don't think they should end it this program, even today this software created by the old macromedia is incredibly fast and easy to use to do simple designer tasks, and it works very well on weak machines, without a video card, doing much with 5% of the memory and disk space that PS needs it to run nowadays, and it also works very well with vectors, something that Photoshop doesn't do well, I can't, for example, send a vector from Illustrator to Photoshop or open an EPS without it being a bitmap in full 2025 wtf, but I can save it do it in Fireworks and even in photopeia in psd and open the shape vector in PS for example, so I'm sorry but FW is still something extremely useful for doing a lot of things that PS and Illustrator do in a very heavy way, I even got to buy Infinity but it is still heavy compared to the old version of FW, so please don't kill FW ever, if you don't want to support it, just remove the dependency on its license,
 
And here is my solution, unfortunately, so that everyone is sure, in recent months when installing FW it was asking for the installation of the Adobe Manager license management program that Creative Cloud did the favor of not installing in new versions of Cs6 applications, the download link was disabled, so find out how to download via the link \_all.exe but now it is asking for 30 days, and when I I log in with my account and ask for the serial number,
 
So, Adobe, either you solve this in a legal way, or there will only be one "not legal" solution left to do this, which would be to just change a "famous dll" that I won't say the name of, here and finally disable the license and software dependency. Adobe Manager and everyone will finally be able to freely use our FW, I think it would be fair since they paid and have the right to use their license.
