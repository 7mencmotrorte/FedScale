As we prepare for a life outside of college, we may find ourselves walking through the heat. It is key to remember the stories of those who have persevered to keep us going. Award-winning author and motivational keynote note speaker, Erica Alfaro, is one of those people.
 
Graduates, the time is now to go after what we want. I hope that by sharing her story with you, you will always have a source of inspiration to look toward as we progress in this transitory period in our lives.

Her son motivated her to re-enroll back into school in 2014 and later finish her degree in Psychology, at Cal State San Marcos. This same college that she found herself academically disqualified from, selected her as the commencement speaker for their graduation ceremony.
 
When graduation approached, Alfaro wanted to honor her parents who worked in agriculture fields for their sacrifices. As a surprise, she took them to the very fields they worked in and was captured alongside them for a graduation picture.
 
A script of her book is under review by Netflix after its nomination from The International Latino Book Awards. Multiple community college classrooms and highschool courses for English Language Development will start using her book as part of curriculum in the next school year.
 
From a young age, just like Alfaro would give speeches to her teddy bears, I would give improvised television news reports to my grandma. Much of my younger years were spent performing to entertain her. I waited for her applause or laugh every time. They never fail to this day, my grandmother is 88 now.
 
I have lived through multiple of these full-circle instances in my life. What I have learned from those experiences is that there is a reason for the desires in our hearts. Do not suppress the dreams planted intentionally inside of you by our creator.
 
She has a newfound support system in her marriage to Jose Manuel, in which they share a mutual respect for one another, and as Alfaro looks ahead she plans to make a movie about her life within the next 10 years.
 
Ruiz will be a first-generation Fresno State graduate from her family. Her parents moved to the United States so she and her siblings could have better opportunities. Ruiz relates to Alfaro on proving people wrong when they speak doubt over her own life.
 
She took a year off and knew she wanted to return to school, but was constantly reminded by her family that they found her return to school hard to believe. Ruiz did not let that stop her and she signed up to participate in commencement on May 17.
 
For most of her college experience, Ruiz had to figure things out on her own. She lacked a support system from her parents, who found themselves in constant disagreements with each other, leading to a toxic home environment.
 
Seeing her little brothers screaming or crying in the midst of chaos is one of the more painful experiences that Ruiz recalls. It is thanks to them and those difficult experiences that she did not give up on finishing school.
 
Jonathan Hernandez, a Porterville College professor, recognizes that some students in his classroom can be going through some of the same things Alfaro went through. This has helped him create a learning space with more empathy, love and kindness.
 
The **Evergreen G class** is a series of 11 container ships built for Evergreen Marine by Imabari Shipbuilding in Japan. The maximum theoretical capacity of these ships is in the range of 20,124 to 20,388 standard shipping containers (twenty-foot equivalent unit TEU).[1][*failed verification*]
 
The ships constitute 11 out of 13 container ships built to the *Imabari 20000 TEU containership* design developed by Imabari Shipbuilding. Evergreen time charters all 11 ships from their owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha, which is a leasing subsidiary of Imabari Shipbuilding. On 30 March 2018, the first ship the *Ever Golden* was delivered with a capacity of 20,338 TEU.
 
In 2019, Evergreen announced it would be putting scrubbers on many of their ships in order to lower polluting emissions.[2] *Ever Glory* and all newer ships were built with scrubbers already installed. These scrubbers take up a considerable amount of space and the resulting capacity of these ships is slightly reduced to 20,160 TEU. The previous ships that did not have scrubbers when they were built had them retrofitted. This has reduced their capacity to 20,124 TEU.
 
On 9 February 2019, the *Ever Given* collided with the ferry *Finkenwerder*, which was docked at a wharf in Hamburg on the river Elbe at the time. The *Finkenwerder* was heavily damaged.[3]
 
In March 2021, the *Ever Given* ran aground and blocked the Suez Canal for six days.[4] The ship was freed but then held in the Great Bitter Lake over a declared 900 million dollar compensation claim by the Suez Canal Authority,[5] which they settled with owner Shoei Kisen Kaisha for $540 million in early July.[6]
 
The Golden Class of 1972 plans to give a gift of $100,000 for an endowed scholarship. Once fully endowed, the scholarship will exist in perpetuity, ensuring the legacy of the Class of 1972 and its commitment to Jackson State University for generations to come. Two scholarships will be awarded annually. The scholarship will be announced at the Society of Golden Tigers Brunch on Friday, October 21, 2022, and the $100,000 check will be presented to President Thomas K. Hudson at half-time during the homecoming game.
 
We need all of your support to reach our goal. We are asking each classmate to give a **minimum of $500** toward our scholarship whether you attend the graduation ceremony or homecoming. We have developed multiple giving levels with benefits, allowing classmates to give at their comfort or stretch level (see attachment). Of course, any donation is appreciated. For your convenience, you may give in installments. The deadline for endowment giving is **October 8, 2022**.
 
The 1972 Golden Class Planning Committee made the decision, on behalf of the class, to dedicate a Memorial Bench in honor of the deceased members of the Class of 1972 to be placed on campus. This will be the first Bench ever placed on the campus by an alumni class. The bench will be in the **Legacy Garden** located across from the New Student Center next to the Administration Tower building and near the Circle of Flags. The cost is $5,000 that goes to the University. We respectfully request each member to support the cost of this tribute through a contribution of **$50**.
 
The ship is a reference to the real Golden-class container ship, *Ever Given* (owned by Evergreen Marine Corporation), that blocked the Suez Canal in 2021. Due to sudden strong winds and a dust storm, the ship ran aground diagonally, with her bow wedged in a bank of the canal. She was eventually re-floated after 6 days.

We will fly into Geneva and stay in Montreaux for a couple of nights to get over the lag. We (2 of us) intend to buy a 4 day B O pass and 1/2 fare card for our time in BO (later in the trip), but will also use it to take the Golden Pass Express to Lucerne for a couple of nights before going to BO.   
 **My problem that I need help with is this**: Today I went on line to reserve seats for the Golden Pass Express from Montreaux to Interlaken Ost and there were no seats available on the date we leave for Lucerne i
