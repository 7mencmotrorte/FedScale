We have 2 children who share a room and listen to different audio books every night with their headphones. We have been checking out the playaways from the library. We are looking for a device they can control that has music and audiobooks (checked out from Libby or overdrive) on it? What would you suggest for this? Thanks so much!

At what age did you start? My daughter is 3. She will listen to tapes of short books that she already has and knows well and has in front of her to flip through as she follows along but only as long as Im around. Otherwise, she loses interest quickly. Im wondering if she is too young are am I doing this wrong.
 
How do you and your husband share an Audible account? Just share the login and password for one account? What about your kids? Do they have their own Audible account? Currently my son listens through my account on his Echo.

**Zoey and Sassafras by Asia Citro.**This is a delightful series about a little girl and her sidekick cat that cure magical animals with their scientific knowledge. My girls LOVE this one (although currently only the first book is available as an audio book).
 
**The Boxcar Children by Gertrude Chandler Warner.**This is the #1 audio book series for preschoolers in our house. My oldest daughter refused to listen to anything else for four solid months and sobbed when she reached the end of the series. My second daughter also developed a massive love for these audio books when she was 4 and 5 and now my third daughter, who is 5, listens to them every single night (Epic! has a great collection of them and you can try it free for a month here!).
 
**Juana and Lucus by Juana Medina.**Juana loves her life in Columbia. She does NOT love learning English, until her grandfather gives her a very compelling reason to start learning it. This one is fun because it also has Spanish words sprinkled into the narration.
 
**26 Fairmont Ave by Tomie dePaola.**You probably know Tomie dePaola from his beloved Strega Nona series (and a bazillion other wonderful books), but these short chapter books about his growing up are so sweet and fun. There are four books in the series and each one runs just under an hour.
 
**Zapato Power** **by Jacqueline Jules.** These books run about 30-40 minutes each and they feature Freddie, a little boy who comes home to find a mysterious package that contains shoes that give him super speed.
 
As always, these are some great suggestions. I'd really like to find a calmer quiet time activity since things have become a bit rowdy in their rooms and this might be the perfect solution (especially for my older daughter). I hope our library offers audio books!
 
My twin boys are 7, but they have been listening to audio books since they were 3. They listen to them every night before bed and any time we travel. They also LOVE them. We have listened to so many over the past 4 years I can't remember them all, but some of their favorites have been: House at Pooh Corner, Welcome to the Bed & Biscuit, The Mouse & the Motorcycle, Hank the Cowdog series, Rabbit Ears Storybooks, anything by Jim Weiss, Mercy Watson collection, Roscoe Riley series, and the Catwing series (3 books).
 
You know that moment when you've had a post all planned out and then someone writes the exact same post? Yeah, that just happened to me. I guess it makes sense that we would be thinking along the same lines . . . my four-year-old is also an audiobook junkie. My post isn't going up until March, but I purposely didn't read your thoughts (even though I desperately wanted to!) because I want to just write out my own ideas first (of course). Yay for audiobooks!
 
I'm a little bit amazed that your daughter will sit for an hour to do ANYTHING. The idea of either of my sons sitting for an hour and coloring while they listen to an audiobook is honestly unbelievable to me. My children have never in their lives colored. They used the crayons as missiles (like for shooting out of a vacuum tube or something), so I had to get rid of them.
 
Addie is my wild child so her attention span isn't always great (unless she's playing something new on the ipad!) But I think I might start this in the car first and see what she thinks of it. I have a huge box of pictures books + cds from my teaching days but we don't own a darn cd player anymore so I haven't been able to utilize them! Never thought to bring them in the car. Definitely going to give it a try! And then maybe we will need to break down and buy a cd player or upload the picture book css to an ipod or something!
 
I originally found your site on Pinterest ( the tortellini recipe). I too am a lover of books and now that we have our first grandchild I am carrying on that tradition. I do have to comment about Mrs. Piggle Wiggle- I adored reading all about her as a child, in fact she was who encouraged me to always have an apple and cocoa with a cookie ? . Funny the things we pick up as children! 
Right now we are still exploring the world of board books with our Avary, but I can't wait to share in the joys Mrs. Piggle Wiggle.
 
I saw some really cute $5 headphones with padded headbands and ear pieces at the Target dollar spot and bought a pair for each of my older kids for our airplane flight this Christmas. They're marvelous! And did I mention cute? It was much easier for my cheap self to swallow $5 a pair than $20.
 
Got a long road trip coming up? An audiobook may be just the thing to keep kids entertained -- and parents, too. Audiobooks also are a perfect treat for a sick day or a private listening experience anytime. So get out your earbuds or headphones, or just blast a book through your speakers. We've gathered a list of books we know have excellent audio versions, some read by the authors themselves. Check 'em out and tune in! You'll find other captivating tales on our Read-Aloud Books and Great Books for Summer Travel lists.
 
My research focused on the impact of **vocabulary and language exposure** in the home, starting with a seminal study by Hart and Risley (1995) that showed vast differences in exposure across **socioeconomic backgrounds**.
 
The trend has continued (Gordon et al., 2021; Rahn et al., 2022), which is why I outline this information in the first module of Language Therapy Advance Foundations, my program that teaches a framework for language therapy.
 
Activities that build vocabulary, like listening to audiobooks, impact skills that**support reading**. But if you want to want to be able to read through print, you have to regularly practice the skill directly.
 
**Decoding** requires you to look at a set of print symbols and pair those symbols to a **phonological representation**of a word. You have to say the sounds in sequence in your head, or even subvocalize them so you can **recognize** what the word is (Sutherland, 2006).
 
If you want to get better at reading, you need to practice looking at the print symbols and having opportunities to **actively engage** with them. I share some strategies for facilitating this process in Language Therapy Advance Foundations.
 
Many districts in my state are prioritizing **skill-building activities** like **reading and math** and are transitioning to **project-based learning** in the older grades with time in study hall to get work done.

The Read-Aloud Revival championed by Sarah MacKenzie has brought to light the many benefits of hearing stories and books in the home. Shared books inspire, cultivate relational warmth, and promote learning. In fact, children can comprehend advanced concepts through aural learning long before they can decode them phonetically on the page. Psychologists have found that babies and toddlers who hear more words in the home are at an advantage when they become school-aged.
 
The same is true for books and audiobooks. Each have their benefits and disadvantages, but it would be unfortunate to assume they are essentially identical. Well-intentioned as they may be, many parents are operating under this false equivalence. We assume, or at least hope, the same educational benefits come from hearing and reading.
 
Students who rarely read have infrequent visual encounters with words. The effect is cumulative and debilitating. Without years of regularly seeing text on a page they will have a limited bank of sight words. When it comes time to write papers, they will be clueless as to how to spell even basic words. Those who can decode will do their best to sound out words, but writing will be an absolute slog. Imagine: To write a basic five-paragraph essay a high schooler not only has to wrestle with complex ideas but also has to struggle for the correct spelling of every other word they want to use in composing those thoughts. Absolute torture.
 
There are certain questions students who read never have to ask themselves: Do I indent a paragraph? Do I capitalize the first letter of the sentence? Does the period go inside or outside of the quotation marks? They pick up these rules as they read. In-class teaching only reinforces what they already know.
 
Literacy is a precious gift. In the narrative of his own life, Frederick Douglass recounts how learning to read and write were the key to his freedom. His mistress bega
