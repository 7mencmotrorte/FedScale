The departmental faculty has established a process to periodically review and revise its two programs' educational objectives after obtaining feedback from its primary constituent groups. The faculty also is committed to teaching professional and ethical responsibility by example and by practice. The active sponsored research activities of the faculty ensure the program curricula remain contemporary and motivate the need for life-long learning.
 
Technical electives provide the student an opportunity to achieve a greater breadth of knowledge and some degree of specialization in selected areas of special interest. Electives are offered in both electrical engineering and computer engineering application areas.
