The first few chapter tasks of **Potion Craft** are easy enough to figure out through tutorial help, however in Chapter Two players will be tasked with creating a potion with multiple effects - meaning, the potion will need to contain properties from two or more potions. The task itself does not indicate any specific potion types, so creating any potion with 2 effects in Potion Craft will satisfy the requirement.
 
Many Potion Craft potions will require guesswork and exploring the alchemy map using as few ingredients as possible to identify. When crafting potions with multiple effects, it is easiest to use potion types that are close to each other on the alchemy map. For example, the healing potion is relatively close to the frost potion, so creating a potion with the effects of frost and healing is easy to make with few ingredients.

There are 41 different effects Potions in Potion Craft can have, but not all of them are compatible with each other! To see which potion effects are compatible with each other, check out the official Potion Craft Wiki for a detailed breakdown!
 
Players will have already crafted a Frost Potion by this point (which uses two Waterbloom) so to create a healing potion with multiple effects in Potion Craft, all they would need to gather is one more Waterbloom and one Terraria. Complete the path to the Frost Potion by combining two Waterbloom in the cauldron and the mortal/pestle, then add the ingredients for the healing potion by putting one Waterbloom and one Terraria through the cauldron and mortar. Crafting this combination will give players a potion with 2 effects in **Potion Craft**.
 
I have a new character, and I'm currently levelling both my Alchemy and Speechcraft, by crafting potions in a store and selling them to the merchant in order to buy more ingredients. However, most of my potions are worth fairly little.
 
I've noticed that a potion with "Slow" as an effect is worth anywhere from 400 - 600 gold, depending on secondary effects, compared to about 80 for a restore health potion. Are there more valuable effects I should be looking for?
 
That said, purchasing ingredients from the merchants can be a very inefficient way to generate money. Vendors will charge more for the ingredients then the average yield for the potions - especially with higher quality potions that require more expensive reagents.
 
You might find it more beneficial to create low value potions. Consider how much the ingredients are being purchased for. Higher-value potions may not earn you back as much in comparison to lower-quality potions that require cheaper ingredients. You can generally make more of them at a time, due to availability of ingredients, in turn generating more experience. **The best value advice is to harvest your own ingredients,** but you appear to be favoring merchant ingredients for working on your speechcraft.
 
For a total value of 555 when made with no perks and a skill total of 100. That's better than twice the value of Slow (247). Throw in some perks & late game skill totals ( 100 base + 4 Fortify Alchemy enchantments @ up to 25 each if you're not doing your own enchants ) and the value gets very high. Note that the Purity perk will neutralize the Weakness to Magic effect for a far more drinkable potion, but a 10% drop in sales value.

Best of all, if you've got skyrim-hearthfire, these 3 ingredients may be grown in the garden of your rural estate(s). Plant 3 of the Creep Clusters and 5 of each of the mushrooms and you'll be able to harvest enough for 15 potions every few game days. If you've got all 3 estates, that adds up to a pretty profit that will easily absorb the cash flows of every fence in the game. Add in a Green House as the west wing of one or more of your estates and you're being gratuitous for profit purposes; or perhaps you are just grinding out Legendary Alchemy levels at little cost or effort?
 
Provided my algorithm is correct, there is a total of 17 461 potions that you can brew using any valid combination of two or three ingredients. From those, the following ones are the definite winners in the value category:
 
I can give you some basic guidelines but you will ultimately want to find a tool like this one: You can put in your ingredients and it will give you the most expensive potion combinations you can make. This is also very good for just figuring out ingredients if you don't want to guess and not really waste materials.
 
The guidelines are this though, you want as many effects as you can possibly put into a single potion. It does not matter helpful or hurtful purity. An additional effect on the potion will result to additional value.
 
The next thing you want to take a look at are going to be the effects. Common health potions, as you saw, are not as worth while as things like Slow, Paralysis. Other effects that tend to be a high price point are Regeneration Buffs or Debuffs as well. Ones that raise skills are also a bit useful.
 
Why I can't say just pick one of these types is that you want to find which combinations you can make with your ingredients to get the most bang for your buck. That is where the calculator I linked before makes it easier. You can also find a mod that will do this same thing for you in-game (but its a little ... bit buggy last time I tried it).
 
NOTE: There are going to be some exceptions to this due to ingredient rarity. For example if you take the root given to you in the course of the Dark Brotherhood quest, it will give you a Very expensive poison.
 
For low levels, I recommend the Blue Potion. This is not, of course, the name of it the game. It's a potion that requires on blue mountain flower and one blue butterfly wing, ingredients that are ridiculously common everywhere in Skyrim. The effects are fortify conjuration and damage magicka regeneration. It's completely useless for personal use, but it's worth a ton.
 
So, all I need to do is add a potion effect to a player. I've managed to get the player object already, so I have access to that. I'm just not quite sure how to use addPotionEffect correctly. I've been trying many variations to get it to atleast accept it. But yeah, here is a very small part of my code. I've seen around the internet that they go Potion.getPotionByID(), or was it PotionEffect.getPotionByID()? Either way, it doesn't seem to be supported here.
 
Apparently I'm a complete and utter jerk and come to this forum just like to make fun of people, be confrontational, and make your personal life miserable. If you think this is the case, **JUST REPORT ME**. Otherwise you're just going to get reported when you reply to my posts and point it out, because odds are, I was trying to be nice.
 
I was going to do that, but I was going out for the day, and decided to post a question instead. When I get home I'll just do it, was hoping I could just jump right into it when I get home later today
 
Here is the example. 19 is id of potion which is equals to Poison, 100 is duration of potion 20ticks per second, so 100 is equals to 5 seconds. and 0 is a level of potion. (zero-based) so if you type 2 for level, it equals level 3 potion effect. You can get ids from net.minecraft.potion.Potion.java.
 
Simulation games come in a stunning variety. So of course, there's one that lets the player role-play an Alchemist. **Potion Craft** has a medieval setting, but there's some magic in these gardens and rocks, and their properties are waiting to be uncovered by a dedicated master of potions and plants.
 
As the curator of the local Alchemy shop, players in this sim game have to meet the demands of the locals when it comes to medicines, tinctures, and potions. One of the secrets aspiring Alchemists find during their training is how to brew a potion with more than one effect. Clients will start to request this feature specifically as the chapters progress, and they'll pay extra for it.
 
The Tutorial for the game walks players through the process of making a potion, but this example only has a single effect. Most of the new recipes during this point of the game will be of this simple variety. To make a potion with two effects, the Alchemist must have already discovered at least one other potion and a wider portion of the map.
 
There are a variety of tools the Alchemist has in their Laboratory that can move the potion bottle. Learning how to use these basic tools, in addition to a variety of herbs and regents, is essential for making a potion with two effects.
 
Potions have either positive or negative effects. Combining two contrary properties is possible but not always profitable. Combining a Poison potion with a Healing potion doesn't make a lot of sense, but combining Healing with Agility might work.
