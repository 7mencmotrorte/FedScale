The game is through PC game pass, the game has been reinstalled, verified many times, Drivers are up to date, same with windows, antivirus exclusions for the folder, have tried changing to dx11, ran as admin, created new user accounts in case of corruption, tried screen scaling through Nvidia, all requirements are met, tried low graphics, scanned pc for corruption and repaired through command console, tried repair and reset through settings, tried no default Fullscreen settings, compatibility through properties, even profile picture changes (apparently 2 years ago broke the games spaghetti code), couldn't get the game in windowed mode, tried resetting/removing entire appdata for warhammer, and crash logs are not made when this happens for some reason, through eventfinder i found that the issue may be related to windows access to certain files. Because i did all of this the issue may be network based, or a newer issue, or may be related to windows access. If there are any reccommended things to try that I havent attempted that would be good to know. (don't know if this matters but it doesn't freeze, just instantly seemingly randomly crashes)
 
Hey there @Banana2842#6592

As you have tried so much already and the problem still persists I'd like you to raise this to Sega Support by clicking here as they can better assist with the problems you're experiencing, they'll need your **dmp.file** from your crash report logs, this will be the one that generates directly after the crash happens, they'll also need the link to this thread so they can see why we have forward you to them for additional support.

Thank you
