I mentioned that these biscuits are easy so **do not be alarmed**by all the tips that I have for you below. These biscuits are easy, but technique matters and I want to arm you with all the information that you need so that you can make these easily and have them come out perfectly the very first time.
 
While you can certainly use a pastry cutter to cut your butter into the dry ingredients, I recommend freezing your butter for about 30 minutes before beginning. Then, use a box grater to grate the butter before combining this in with your dry ingredients.
 
And yes, I do recommend using unsalted butter in this recipe and then adding salt. If you want to know more about why I write my recipes this way, you can read all about it (and an easy substitution if you only have salted butter on hand) in this post that I wrote about salted vs unsalted butter.
 

I have tried making biscuits from scratch in the past, and they always turn out horrible (so horrible in fact, that I made a back up can of biscuits today just in case). I am so glad I found this recipe, though, because they turned out awesome! So good that no one ate the sad canned biscuits. Since I have already tried several other recipes on your site, I should have known that no insurance would be needed, ha.
 
Hi Victoria! Are you weighing your flour? It could be that you are over-measuring or adding too much during the lamination process. Overworking can absolutely cause the dense texture. Hopefully they turn out better next time!
 
Now, we can add the remaining hummus ingredients. I like adding the chickpeas in two batches, processing the first batch for a minute before adding the rest. Then, I stand back and let my food processor run.
 
When it looks close to done, I add a splash of cold water while the processor is still running. After a few tablespoons of water, the mixture transforms into **fluffy, creamy, whipped hummus.**
 
2Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the whipped tahini and lemon juice. Process for 30 seconds, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, and then process for another 30 seconds or until well blended.
 
3Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add the remaining chickpeas and process them until thick and relatively smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
 
4The hummus will likely be too thick and still have tiny bits of chickpea. To fix this, slowly add 2 to 3 tablespoons of cold water or aquafaba with the food processor turned on until you reach the perfect consistency.
 
Wow! This is a great recipe. Super easy and delicious. I had to make a substitution because I realized I didnt have any tahini on hand so I used sunflower butter and it still came out great. Thanks for sharing this. It will definitely be on replay to make again in my house.
 
With just 10 minutes of prep, this easy, overnight recipe uses active sourdough starter to create the best soft & chewy NY-style bagel. Customize with zesty everything bagel spice, sesame seeds and more! Recipe adapted from my bestselling book: Artisan Sourdough Made Simple.
 
The chewy texture of bagels is best enjoyed when made fresh. Store in a plastic bag at room temperature for up to 2 days. Bagels also freeze well; freeze them whole or sliced, covered in plastic wrap and a layer of foil, for up to 3 months.
 
These are a new family favorite so easy to make dough easy to work with love they are lighter then ones you buy in store. I follow recipe leave out only 4hrs then in fridge overnight bake next day excellent recipe ?
 
Maybe more gluten development is needed? I usually let my dough autolyse after making sure all the flour is incorporated before kneading.  
How much does your dough rise before you divide and shape?
 
Thanks for the great recipe. This was so easy and the resulting dough was great to work with. We just had them, fresh from the oven. They were crispy on the outside and surprisingly flufdyvon this inside. I see a lot of sourdough bagels in our future.
 
Hi Julie! My pleasure :) No need to half the recipe. Boil all of the bagels, bake 4, and then leave the remaining 4 on the sheet pan at room temp. (no need to refrigerate). Then bake the second batch when the first one is done. Does that make sense?
 
So I have basically been obsessed with this recipe for the past year! Of all of the bagel recipes I have tried, these are the best! BY FAR! I also appreciate that their is no additional yeast added, just sourdough! I have made hundreds of these bagels for family, friends and baby showers. I do not sell these, but rather gift them. Thank you so much for the recipe! I have done cheese (any kind), everything, cinnamon crunch with cinnamon chips added to dough, chocolate chip, blueberry, and more! I have wondered the nutritional value as we eat a lot of these! LOL I did a quick calculator and came up with the following for a plain bagel:
 
Loved using this recipe! It works beautifully for my Plain, Everything, and/or Onion bagels. I was wondering though, if I made a bagel that had ingredients which would naturally increase the hydration (such as Blueberry), would it be a 1:1 switch for water to blueberry mix? If not, is there a standard hydration level to aim for with those varieties?
 
So my original starter met its demise thanks to our moving company. Then I started another but it never seemed quite right. This was the first recipe I tried with my latest starter and they were awesome! My husband (a bagel afficionado and uber fussy) was RAVING about them. I had made regular bagels before but always in a salt bath. The honey really added another layer. Followed the recipe to at T and it was perfect. Thank you so much!
 
yup. i mix the dough and leave it out for a bit so that i can knead it once or do a couple stretch and folds and then i cover the bowl with saran wrap to keep the dough from drying out and stick it in the fridge. for reference- last time i made the bagels i made the dough at 10pm saturday night and then made the bagels around 7pm sunday evening. i did take the dough out of the fridge at around 4pm but i dont always do that.  
hope this helps
