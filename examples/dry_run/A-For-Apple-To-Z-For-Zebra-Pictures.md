I've changed my user profile picture on my MacBook to a picture which is 1920x1080 and cropped it so it fits into the frame. When I lock my MacBook the user picture is fine, however when I login into my MacBook after it's been turned off the user picture is blurry. I've already seen a question like this but it was just with the login screen, they didn't say about when the screen was locked and it's a 7 year old question, so I thought it may have changed since then, any help would be appreciated.
 
Use a picture from the Photos app: Click Photos. To see specific photos from a time, place, or album, click a disclosure triangle below photos, then select a group of photos. Select a picture, then click Next.

Thanks for getting back to us. The next step you can try is reinstalling macOS. This step won't erase any data and can help narrow down the issue. Prior to any steps, you should always make sure to have your data backed up: Back up your Mac
 
Thanks for replying, I changed the the picture back to a default one provided by apple and it was still blurry, (I changed it to the penguin one) I then did this on a test account and it made no difference at all, the pictures are fine if I Sign out/lock the screen then enter my password to log back in. However, if the macbook is turned off by either shut down/restart this is when the picture becomes blurry. I reset the NVRAM like you said and nothing has changed, I tried the football default picture and the zebra, both are still blurry after start up.
 
Here are the photos, it's kind of hard to tell when taking a picture of the screen on the phone but as you can probably tell the darker one is the blurry one (after just being powered up) and the lighter one is when the laptop has been to sleep or genuinely on the lock screen.
 
But now the researchers behind the AI model powering the doodle-to-cat-monster tool are back with another impressive image manipulation implementation that lets you turn horses into zebras, apples into oranges, winters into summers and so much more.
 
This means the algorithm can be easily tweaked to perform a multitude of different tasks and transformations. For instance, it could turn paintings into photos as easily as it could turn photos into paintings (and then even add various styles to them).
