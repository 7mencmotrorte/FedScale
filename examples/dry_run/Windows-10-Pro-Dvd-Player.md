Ever since getting version 5 of Malwarebytes on my Windows 11 system, Windows Media Player Legacy (v12) won't play .mp3, mp4 or other any media files.
I eventually get "not responding" in the media player, and also get one or both of the following errors ... "The RPC server is unavailable / The remote procedure call failed"
 
RPC services are running, and I've tried all suggested built in Windows troubleshooters, removed and re-adding media player
The new media player works, as does VLC, but I'm one of many that prefer the old WMP
 
I did try turning off the individual protection settings and also all of them at once which helped at first, but after a couple of successful views, problem came back.
I just tried turning off Malware & Pup protection by itself, same thing, worked a couple of times and problem came back
I also cleared any settings in WMP that might connect to the internet, even disable network adapters with no change
 
**The fix may possibly take up to 60 minutes to complete**

If the tool needs a restart please make sure you let the system restart normally and let the tool complete its run after restart.
The tool will make a log named **Fixlog.txt** in the same folder you ran the **Farbar** program from. Please attach that log on your next reply.

I have installed Xibo 1.7.7 player in Windows 10 PC and it works fine except from the fact that when I close it, it auto restarts after a few seconds so I had to uninstall it in order to be able to work. I have found settings to disable auto restart but there are only for Android profiles. How can I disable auto restart in Windows?
 
Find and highlight the XIBO application by clicking it. Then click DISABLE bottom right. Next time you restart the PC the watchdog application will not start but you do not have to rename anything nor uninstall it. This applies to any start-up application by the way.
 
Apologies. I note earlier this refers to 1.7.8. The version I use (1.7.6) obviously does not have this functionality. I would like to see the installer differentiate between a system used for development and one used to play the presentation. This could stop both this problem and the XIBO player auto start-up problem.
 
But I do love the software, with all its quirks, and have it running on 5 displays in a fish and chip shop without any problems (other than Win10 keep wanting to update itself even though I have told it not to).
 
Also, John is actually correct (I just tested it). The Windows 10 Task Manager groups tasks by vendor, so when startup is disabled for Xibo, it is disabled for both the Player AND the Watch Dog process, creating the effect the original poster was after.

The following instructions apply to the Windows Media player. The steps to be followed depend upon the version of the player installed. Note: After making the selections described, it may be necessary to close down Windows Media player and restart it for the changes you have made to take effect.
 
Please note that it is recommended that you choose to view the video from the FDA page rather than downloading the video file to preserve captioning. If the video is downloaded captions may not be displayed because your WMV player cannot find the captioning ("SAMI") file stored on the web server.
 
**Windows Media Player** (**WMP**, officially referred to as **Windows Media Player Legacy** to distinguish it from the new Windows Media Player introduced with Windows 11), is the first media player and media library application that Microsoft developed to play audio and video on personal computers. It has been a component of the Microsoft Windows operating system, including Windows 9x, Windows NT, Pocket PC, and Windows Mobile. Microsoft also released editions of Windows Media Player for classic Mac OS, Mac OS X, and Solaris, but has since discontinued them.
 
In addition to being a media player, the app can rip audio file from compact discs, burn Audio CDs or MP3 CDs, synchronize content with a digital audio player or mobile devices, and stream media over the local network. Originally, it could connect to a number of online music stores, allowing its users to purchase digital music. The default file formats are Windows Media Video (WMV), Windows Media Audio (WMA), and Advanced Systems Format (ASF), and its own XML based playlist format called Windows Playlist (WPL). The player is also able to utilize a digital rights management service in the form of Windows Media DRM.
 
Windows Media Player is a unique component, in that since 1999, each version of Windows came with two or more versions of it side-by-side. For example, Media Player versions 5.1, 6.4, and 8 were all included in Windows XP. Each versions of Windows may bundle several other media playback apps, namely ActiveMovie Control, CD Player, DVD Player, Windows Media Center, and Microsoft Movies & TV.
 
Windows Media Player 11 is the last out-of-band version of Media Player. It was made available for Windows XP and is included in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Version 12 was released in 2009 along with Windows 7[b] and has not been made available for previous versions of Windows nor has it been updated ever since.[2][3] Windows 8 bundled Windows Media Player 12 along two other media player apps, namely Xbox Video and Xbox Music. The latter was renamed Groove Music in Windows 10, and then finally Media Player in Windows 11[4] which has also been backported to Windows 10.[5]
 
The first version of Windows Media Player appeared in 1991, when Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions was released.[6] Originally called Media Player, this component was included with "Multimedia PC"-compatible machines but not available for retail sale. It was capable of playing .mmm animation files, and could be extended to support other formats.[7] It used MCI to handle media files. Being a component of Windows, Media Player shows the same version number as that of the version Windows with which it was included.
 
Microsoft continually produced new programs to play media files. In November of the following year, Video for Windows was introduced with the ability to play digital video files in an AVI container format,[8] with codec support for RLE and Video1, and support for playing uncompressed files. Indeo 3.2 was added in a later release. Video for Windows was first available as a free add-on to Windows 3.1, and later integrated into Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. In 1995, Microsoft released ActiveMovie with DirectX Media SDK. ActiveMovie incorporates a new way of dealing with media files, and adds support for streaming media (which the original Media Player could not handle). In 1996, ActiveMovie was renamed DirectShow.[9] However, Media Player continued to come with Windows until Windows XP, in which it was officially renamed Windows Media Player v5.1.[10] ("v5.1" is the version number of Windows XP).
 
In 1999, Windows Media Player's versioning broke away from that of Windows itself. Windows Media Player 6.4 came as an out-of-band update for Windows 95-98 and Windows NT 4.0 that co-existed with Media Player and became a built-in component of Windows 2000, Windows ME, and Windows XP with an *mplayer2.exe* stub allowing to use this built-in instead of newer versions.[11] Windows Media Player 7.0 and its successors also came in the same fashion, replacing each other but leaving Media Player and Windows Media Player 6.4 intact. Windows XP is the only operating system to have three different versions of Windows Media Player (v5.1, v6.4, and v8) side by side. All versions branded Windows Media Player (instead of simply Media Player) support DirectShow codecs. Windows Media Player version 7 was a large revamp, with a new user interface, visualizations and increased functionality. Windows Vista, however, dropped older versions of Windows Media Player in favor of v11, which included the removal of the Windows Media Source Filter (DirectShow codec).
 
In 2004, Microsoft launched digital music store MSN Music for new Windows Media Player 10 to compete with Apple iTunes.[12][13]However, MSN Music was discontinued already in 2006 with the launch of Zune music players.[14]
 
Beginning with Windows Vista, Windows Media Player supports the Media Foundation framework besides DirectShow; as such it plays certain types of media using Media Foundation as well as some types of media using DirectShow.[15] Windows Media Player 12 was released with Windows 7. It included support for more media formats and added new features. With Windows 8, however, the player did not receive an upgrade.
 
A different app called Media Player is the successor to Groove Music (previously Xbox Music) and Windows Media Player. Media Player started to be offered to all Windows 11 users on February 15, 2022, with Windows 10 users following in January 2023.**[17]**
 
The new Windows Media Player can also play video, as part of Groove's rebranding from a music streaming service to a media player.[18] Other changes include the album cover view being in fullscreen, and a refresh to the mini player.[19] Accessibility has also been optimized, with some improved keyboard shortcuts and hotkey support for key
