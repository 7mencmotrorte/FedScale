I had my phone working perfectly fine until last night when my battery was nearly 1-2%. It turned off (obviously). But when I reached home and plugged the USB Cable, it only displayed a Gray battery icon with a static ring on it, and that vanished after a few seconds. I gave it sometime (half an hour) to charge. But it still displayed me the same icon.
 
But I noticed something very unusual. After getting my battery 30% charged using my friend's S4, I took my battery back and inserted it back into my phone, turned it on, and plugged the charger. It didn't show me the charging icon. This led me to a conclusion that my phone's charging port is damaged. But after half an hour, I looked at my phone, and now it was 60% charged!

Hi , I am 99% sure that this is a charge port issue . Each pin on the charge port will control a different function such as data , charge power from usb and charge power from wall and others. i would imagine one or more of the pins has let go from the solder pad . I have replaced many Galaxy charge ports due to similar issues and has resolved it every time.
 
I've been having this issue all morning after spilling some water on the table my phone was sitting on the night before. I read this and then decided to blow... into the phone's charger port. It worked. Figured if anyone reading this has that problem... to give that a try before taking their phone in to be repaired/replaced.
 
Ali yusoof thats not a port or a battery prob its something wrong with ur software because it didnt show the charging sign but u told u had charged it to 30% and half and hour later it had charged to 60% withput the charge sign so that shows that it is a software issue have u tried to flash a rom or something.i cant give you a fix if i find one i tell u
 
My phone turned off at the last 1% but I pluged it in immediatly before and it came out of power save showing that the carger was working for it but it still turned off now its dead and doesnt show any sign of carging or turning on but it will give me the missing battery sign when I use my charger without the battery but as soon as I put the battery back in it still shows no sign of charging or turning on
 
Same problem to my lenovo a536, it doesnt show the charging sign but it charges and the bad thing too is when it fulls, the battery drains fast as !&&\* but im pretty surely that this dont have to do with my battery coz its 100% new and the charging pin coz it charges normally. I think its just the system itself and needs reprogrammed. And also when i connected it to a computer it dont connect my phones data btw my phone is rooted and reprogrammed in cyanogenmod version. Any help?
 
My battery was on 1% before it went off. I tried charging for 3hrs and it was still on the same 0%. I managed to switch it on while still charging and maintaining the same 0% to call and it went off along the line. Tried charging it again, by this time, it was not even showing any percentage and gradually, the charging icon failed to show. I changed the down panel totally, yet, not charging nor showing the icon.

I have a kgtel phone, I changed the charging port but it is not charging and not showing the charging status. I also measured the voltage at the battery connector, the is 2V . It's a new battery. What can be the problem
