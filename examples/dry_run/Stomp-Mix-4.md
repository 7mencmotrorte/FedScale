**From ActiveMQ Classic 5.3**: for better scalability and performance the Stomp protocol can be configured to be run over the NIO transport. The NIO transport will use far fewer threads than the corresponding TCP connector. This can help when support for a large number of queues is required. To use NIO change the URI scheme of the transport connector to stomp+nio.

The STOMP protocol (version 1.1 or greater) defines the concept of heart beats as a method by which a client and broker can determine the health of the underlying TCP connection between them. ActiveMQ Classic supports STOMP heart beating provided the client is using version 1.1 (or greater) of the protocol.
 
For backward compatibility, if the grace period multiplier is not configured the default enforcement mode remains strict, e.g., transport.hbGracePeriodMultiplier=1.0. Attempts to configure the grace period multiplier to a value less than, or equal to 1.0 will be silently ignored.
 
Note that the prefix in stomp /queue/ or /topic/ is removed from the string before passing it to ActiveMQ Classic as a JMS destination. Also note that the default separator in MOM systems is . (dot). Whilst FOO.BAR is the normal syntax to identify a queue type destination the Stomp equivalent is /queue/FOO.BAR
 
This same logic can be followed when going from JMS to Stomp, as well. A Stomp client could be written to key off of the inclusion of the content-length header to determine what type of message structure to provide to the user.

The transformation message header on SEND and SUBSCRIBE messages could be used to instruct ActiveMQ Classic to transform messages from text to the format of your desire. Currently, ActiveMQ Classic comes with a transformer that can transform XML/JSON text to Java objects, but you can add your own transformers as well.
 
Associate it with the appropriate header value by creating a file named as a value you want to use in the META-INF/services/org/apache/activemq/transport/frametranslator/ folder of your JAR which will contain the value class=\_fully qualified classname of your transformer\_
 
**From ActiveMQ Classic 5.2**: there is a simple Java Stomp API distributed with ActiveMQ Classic. Note that this API is provided purely for testing purposes and you should always consider using standard JMS API from Java instead of this one. The following code snippet provides a simple example of using this API:
 
Note that STOMP is designed to be as simple as possible - so any scripting language/platform can message any other with minimal effort. STOMP allows pluggable headers on each request such as sending & receiving messages. ActiveMQ Classic has several extensions to the Stomp protocol, so that JMS semantics can be supported by Stomp clients. An OpenWire JMS producer can send messages to a Stomp consumer, and a Stomp producer can send messages to an OpenWire JMS consumer. And Stomp to Stomp configurations, can use the richer JMS message control.

Rename and color are obvious needs. I also think that parameters should be assignable as well. Helix does this with a min/max setting for a given parameter assigned to a stomp. This is very useful to turn up a volume or a gain when you hit a solo.

Custom names in stomp mode.
Custom coloring in stomp and scene mode.
Being able to see the colors dimmed when the stomp is off/scenes are inactive.
Being able to change the text size in gig view, to make short names bigger and easier/faster to read on the gig.
 
This request is still not completely done. Since the release of 2.1.0 it is indeed possible to rename multiple block stomps but assigning a color like it was added for scenes is still missing (and the default white is not helpful). Single block stomps can neither be renamed nor can they be color customized.
 
Isn't that the default behaviour, anyway? Attached is a screen recording. In Seq. 1 I have a cue **Circle Move**. When activated, a circle phaser runs. In Seq. 3 is a static **Position Top** cue. In the **Circle Move** sequences Auto Stomp is active and the sequence settings have Off when Overridden switched off.
 
According to the documentation, this should mean that the moment my **Position Top** cue is activated, the phaser coming from the **Circle Move** cue will be stomped automatically. But that's not the case. Why?
 
And: Would it be correct to state that Auto Stomp only make sense combined with If Off when Overridden being not active. Otherwise, the running cue would be offed automatically, anyway, once the attributes get overwritten by another cue, so it wouldn't even require an Auto Stomp. Is this correct?
 
Only once you add extra information to the relative cue (the colour) is the combined action of the two functions seen (movement stops but sequence stays on) because the Relative sequence is still outputting to the stage.
 
Autostomp is kind of irrelevant for absolute values because you are replacing the absolute phaser data with you new absolute cue data so by the usual LTP principles the phaser will be stopped. So it's not so much it doesn't work with absolute values but more that it's irrelevant with absolute values.
 
I just recently updated both my Helix Rack and HX Stomp to the new 3.0 firmware using Mac OS 10.14 with no issues to the Helix Rack but now after the initial boot screen on the HX stomp, the screen goes black and shows pixelated blue squares where dialog boxes would be on the screen. It still connects to HX Edit and I'm able to navigate that way but the pedal display is not usable. I've tried to factory reset a few times but nothing so far has fixed this issue. Anyone else experience/solve this issue before?
 
You said that you tried a factory reset with no success, but as you note that it can still connect over USB so that it shows in HX Edit, I would possibly be tempted to re-flash the firmware again to see if it clears the issue on the screen.
 
I am having the same issue that you were metalhead, except that the Line 6 updater is not able to connect to the hx stomp no matter what I do. I've restarted my computer, installed the driver necessary, and even tried factory resetting the device. Nothing has worked. It is quite frustrating, I hope someone at line 6 can help with this soon.
 
I'm a Worship Director at a church and we have 3 of these and for some reason, one of them was working totally fine and then the screen went black and we can't get it back. Did the latest frimware update and the update via HX Edit as well and neither of them worked. This really is inconvenient because we are in the middle of preparing for our HUGE Easter production! Has anyone had success with solving this issue?
 
Same thing JUST happened with mine - display is FAINTLY there, full reset doesn't seem to fix it either... I had to take a picture with the lights off and in night mode on my phone for it to even show, otherwise it looks basically black
