The flywings have a small build with 2 bee-shaped wings and a short tail that has no stinger because they de-evolved them. A long time a Hivewing was defective and she had kids and called her kids the Flywings, which was where the name comes from. She changed her name to Queen Fruitfly and became queen of the Flywings. A half the population are non-Fruitfly-offspring-Hivewings that were also defective and they changed their tribe to Flywings. Then, they all moved to a new continent named Requio. Flywings lay gooey eggs and egg larvae.

The War of Alastor was a sad war that was caused by a hybrid named Alastor and he was good but turned aggressive because of a Hivewing sting in his tail. He became infected for 10 years and died at 34 years old.
 
The war happened again when Fly bite Fleshfly and she became insane, aggressive, and rude. She started the war again and made everyone suffer through the bite that Alastor, her distant relative, felt.
 
The Second War of Alastor was stopped by a Hivewing dragonet named Aphid, he found a cure to the problem and made Queen Fleshfly eat the cure and she turned normal. Aphid explained the story of the cure, war, and everything else.
 
This was when the Flywings were at war with the Treewings. The war was harmful and thousands of Treewings died. The FlyWings always were about to win, but Horsefly, princess of the FlyWings, put a stop to the war. The TreeWings liked her uprising to stop the War of Trees, and the FlyWings stopped fighting and the war ended
 
After the War ended the Flywings allied with Queen Jungle of the TreeWings. Queen Jungle liked Princess Horsefly's uprising, and she made an alliance with them granting that if Horsefly was dangerously harmed or had severe injuries Queen Jungle would be there to help her.

The highest class gets better lives and gets what they want/need fast. Queen Horsefly made a rule on them and they are well chosen to have their eggs sold to the orphanage, some High-class Flywings protect them but they still like that idea from Horsefly
 
We all know that Flywings lay egg slime or larva, but during the life cycle of Larva, flies and eggs, during the hatching, the hatchling crawls and eats it way out, the hatchling starts eating some new food from the mother and/or father
