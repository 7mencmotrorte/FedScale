Over the years the series has delivered some of the most memorable experiences. Sadly, a lot of those have been trapped on older consoles or delisted. Basically, playing these games without resorting to nefarious means has become more and more difficult. That brings us to the MGS Master Collection Vol. 1. Yes, the fact that it is labeled as the first volume gives me hope, could MGS 4 finally be out of PS3 prison? This first collection is packed with the original three numbered games as well as a host of extras and the originals from the NES and MSX. This is packed, but how is it presented?
 
Konami certainly packed this collection to the gills. It is also really cool that each game can be purchased separately, but you do lose out on some things without buying the entire collection. This also means that on Xbox there are five separate executables to play these games. One for each entry. One for the extras, and finally one for the classic games. Some of the features overlap on each one, but it is still very cluttered instead of just having it in one place. Some items also have to be installed in each collection such as the graphic novels and Japanese audio tracks, which are required to play certain versions of the games.

You can now pause cut scenes and this can also open a menu where you can update options and switch controller ports, imperative for one of the boss battles. Another nice touch is the ability to modify your save data in the menu. This is used for the same boss battle where you can add various games to a virtual memory card so he can comment on previously played games. You might also need a frequency at a certain point, so the manual can be viewed in this menu.
 
While there are not a lot of upgrades to the games themselves, this collection accomplishes what it set out to do. This package is convenient. We can finally have these games in one place on modern consoles and readily available to play. I think that is something we overlook with some remasters. Being able to just play them without jumping through hoops to get them to work. The price seems steep upfront, but there are five games and tons of variations included. There is a lot of content here and for hardcore MGS fans like me, it is great having all this in one place. I am loving revisiting these games and cannot wait for Vol. 2, please let MGS 4 finally be released from its one console prison.
 
With all-new entries in its flagship Metal Gear Solid series still on hiatus, Konami's release schedule over the last few years has felt thin. Well, except for when it comes to Yu-Gi-Oh! games and Pachinko machines I suppose.
 
It was a very nice surprise, then, to be invited along to a Konami preview event where I got to go hands on with not one, but four upcoming Konami games due out at various points this year. The collection of games on show were rather eclectic and they spanned multiple genres ranging from shmups to family-friendly party games but, crucially, it was just nice to see Konami acting like a video game publisher again.
 
During the event, I was given 50 minute hands-ons with Super Bomberman R 2, CYGNI: All Guns Blazing, Super Crazy Rhythm Castle and of course the biggest draw of all, Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1. You can listen to me tell Aoife Wilson all about my time with that, and all of the other games on show, in the video below, or you can go read all about them in word form just underneath the player.

Super Bomberman R Online started as a Stadia-exclusive game before it jumped over to all the other major platforms as a free-to-play title which provided me with many hours of fun. The fact it was free and had crossplay functionality across all platforms meant that it was an ideal game for some community based live stream shenanigans, or at least it was until December 1st 2022 when Konami shutdown the servers and killed the game for good.
 
Battle 64 then was the first thing I checked out when I sat down to play Super Bomberman R 2 and it was almost identical to the previously free version that I'd played before, bar a couple of new unlockable characters. That means any fans of Battle 64 will now need to fork out around 45 if they want to play a game that they had previously enjoyed for free. Super bummer, man.
 
Now obviously there's more to Super Bomberman R 2 than just Battle 64 and so I also tried out the new Castle mode where attacking players must open treasure chests that defending players are guarding (confusing), the Grand Prix mode where teams must compete to collect the most amount of crystals (boring) and of course the standard Bomberman battle mode that everyone knows and loves (classic).
 
Super Bomberman R 2 also comes with a single-player campaign which we weren't allowed to play or record footage of for fear of 'spoilers', which seems bizarre to me as I can't believe there is anyone out there who cares that deeply about Bomberman lore. But you never know, I guess!
 
Most notably about this collection however, is that I played it on the Switch and it seemed to perform rather badly in moments of high action. Even though I was only playing locally or against bots, often when big explosions happened the game would pause for a second, or chug along until the dust had settled. I'd have maybe expected that if I was playing online with some bad ping going on, but it was worrying to see this happen offline.
 
Developed by Scottish studio KeelWorks Ltd, CYNGI is a top-down, twin-stick vertical scrolling shooter that brings both old-school Konami arcade nostalgia and a dose of modernity, thanks to its gorgeous visuals and accessible gameplay that is less punishing for people who aren't massive fans of the bullet hell genre.
 
For my hands-on with CYGNI, I was allowed to play 3 levels from the game, with the first level lasting around 20 minutes and the other two (levels 3 and 5 I think they were) coming in at around 10 minutes of heavy blasting. Just like most bullet hell style games, the action on screen was overwhelming at times but the game's core mechanic of balancing your shield and weapon systems played a huge part in keeping me alive.
 
Destroyed enemies will drop energy pickups quite regularly which constatly refill your defenses but, at the touch of a button, you can assign that energy to your weapons in order to boost your offensive capabilites. Or, if you end up in trouble, you can do the opposite and power down your weapons in order to give yourself a bit more alive time. This means more skilled players will be able to max out their firepower while newer players will still be able to last a lot longer than your classic one hit kill shmups from the past.
 
While I did enjoy CYGNI's flashy HDR visuals, especially the neon laser fire and the impressive explosions, the rest of it was rather 'grey' to say the least and this meant that the levels I played through did feel rather samey, despite each one having a different boss battle at the end.
 
CYGNI was also the only game on show that I couldn't capture for myself, due to the fact that there were a fair few bugs present in the build. The game crashed to the dashboard for me during a boss fight and the first level was severely unbalanced but with a TBD release date at the moment, there should be plenty of time for some polish.
 
With all that said though, I do see CYGNI as a great entry point for people who've always struggled with top-down shooters before and, as it's also playable in 2 player co-op, this could be the stepping stone that shmup noobs need in order to get into the genre.
 
What do you get when you cross something like Overcooked with Guitar Hero? Most people would think the answer to that would be, 'a complete mess', but in the case of Super Crazy Rhythm Castle the result was surprisingly charming!
 
The whole premise of Super Crazy Rhythm Castle is as absurd as its fever-dream-like level design. Each of the 1 to 4 players picks a wacky character and then they make their way through the Rhythm Castle working co-operatively to juggle playing music, Guitar Hero style by matching button presses to on-screen prompts, with bizarre tasks like throwing beans at angry egg plants.
 
Unfortunately I was only able to play the game solo so I don't think I got the full effect of this one, what with it being a party game and all. To the game's credit it did play absolutely fine in solo mode and the multi-genre toe-tapping tunes I played along with were a joy to listen to. I was also constantly surprised by the originality and inventiveness of the mini games and the game world in general so it'll be great for those with a short attention span too.
 
Let's be honest, you probably skipped all the other write-ups and came straight here, right? Honestly, I don't really blame you, this is the main event of course and it's a collection that legions of Metal Gear Solid fans will be chomping at the bit to get.
 
But it's not just Metal Gear Solid fans who will get something out of the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1. I'm very much a Metal Gear noob, and the only one I've ever completed was Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance on the original Xbox. In fact, this event was the very first time I'd even tried Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and, quite honestly, I left feeling really excited by the prospect of finally having a convient, modern way to rectify a huge hole in my gaming knowledge.
 
While comparisons can be drawn between Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 and Konami's previously released Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, I came away feeling like this collection was more akin to the Atari 50 Collection. The
