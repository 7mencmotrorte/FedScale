The inspiration for The Shelter Cycle came from the author, Peter Rock's experiences with the Church Universal and Triumphant, a religious sect he came into contact with while working on a sheep and cattle ranch near Yellowstone Park in the early 1990s.

 The Church Universal and Triumphant is a religious organization founded in 1975 by Elizabeth Clare Prophet. Its beliefs are based on the wisdom of the "ascended masters," a group of enlightened human beings - "joint heirs with the Christ" - who had once been human, and who now distill wisdom through Elizabeth Clare Prophet. The church was founded to further the goals of The Summit Lighthouse, which was founded in 1958 by Mark L. Prophet (husband of Elizabeth Clare Prophet).

The main form of worship practiced is a kind of rhythmic chanting prayer called decrees. The decrees call on angels, elementals (nature spirits) and the ascended masters to help bring about protection, wisdom, healing and elimination of negative karma on earth.

 The religion, which has local congregations in approximately 20 countries, is generally considered to be part of the New Age movement. It blends aspects of both eastern and western religions, theosophy, mysticism and the paranormal. It became the object of attention and scandal during the 1980s, when it predicted that the end of the world would arrive on March 15, 1990. Believing that Soviet missile strikes (the catalyst for the apocalypse) were imminent, the church, which owned a 6,000-acre piece of land bordering Yellowstone National Park  named "Royal Teton Ranch" spent three years building fallout shelters and preparing to live underground for up to seven years. These three years became known as "the shelter cycle."

On March 15, 1990, thousands of members of the church went underground, only to resurface the next day and discover that nuclear war had not occurred. Some members of the church defected, but many stayed, believing that their decrees had prevented the apocalypse.

Royal Teton Ranch is still the headquarters for the church today. Retreats are held there several times a year. Elizabeth Clare Prophet died in 2009, and while several former church members have attempted to become the official prophet, the church officially operates under a board of directors and council of elders. Members listen to and watch videos released by Prophet before her death. The Summit Lighthouse is the "outreach arm" of the Church Universal and Triumphant, and publishes books, holds youth retreats, and operates online "Ascension" courses through Summit University.

From this moment on throughout our lecture on the message of the Inner Buddha until the Wesak address of our brother and friend of light, Lord Gautama, we are in meditation to establish our blessed attunement (at-one-ment, hence atonement) with the Buddhic light. I recommend that you place your feet flat on the floor and hold your spines erect as the altar of God, your hands cupped resting on your knees, thumbs touching lightly the index finger.
 
In order to greet the Buddha who resides in the secret chamber of the heart, whose chakra is the thousand-petaled lotus of the crown, we desire to raise the sacred fire of the Divine Mother (the Kundalini) from the base chakra of the Mother to the crown chakra of the Buddha.

I would ask you to center your attention in your heart and to realize that it is the flame of your heart that allows you to participate in the ritual of the union of the Father-Mother God in your chakras. Once the Mother reaches the crown chakra she, escorted by her Lord, descends to the secret chamber of the heart where they give birth to the Inner Buddha.
 
And so let us begin with the sounding of the Om. Turn to page 14, numbers 52 and 53 in the booklet that has been passed out to you, Mantras of the Ascended Masters for the Initiation of the Chakras.****
 
Various schools of thought in the New Age as well as in the past century have prescribed their colors for the chakras. People ask me why our colors differ from some of these. My answer is that those we show are the colors released from the Ascended Masters to their Messengers as they should appear in the purified etheric body, the highest vibrating of the four lower bodies and the natural envelope of the soul. I believe that some clairvoyants who have put forth their version of the colors have read the condition of the chakras in the astral, untransmuted, i.e., unpurified, state of the human consciousness, hence the discrepancy.
 
Buddhists celebrate Wesak, the most important festival in the Buddhist world, by meditating on the life and teachings of Lord Gautama, reciting scriptures, fasting, distributing food and money to the monks and the poor, and processioning around Buddhist temples and holy places. Most importantly, the day serves as a reminder that like the Compassionate One, they, too, must attain enlightenment.
 
According to esoteric tradition, on Wesak a huge company of pilgrims and disciples gathers in a valley in the Himalayas to meditate, attune with, and receive the benediction of Lord Gautama. Some say that the Buddha is seen physically by certain adepts and devotees as he brings his blessings to the earth.
 
which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, [who] stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried [i.e., decreed] with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb....
 
These are the saints robed in white who have ascended to the throne of God, which is the goal of life for all who have descended from God. We who gather here for this Wesak celebration are those who, by the path of discipleship following in the footsteps of Buddha and Christ, are striving to accelerate the light in our body temple that we, too, might be among the ascending ones who shall one day enter in to the Holy of holies and be received of the Lord through the ritual of the ascension.
 
The Seven Archangels serve the Lord by embodying his Consciousness and Presence on each of the seven rays. They serve the sons and daughters of God by initiating them in the steps of self-mastery they must gain by embodying the qualities of the seven rays in their seven chakras.
 
The Seventh Ray, which comes to the fore in and rules the two-thousand-year age of Aquarius now beginning, affords the soul the freedom to change the human condition by the ritual and alchemy of the violet flame.
 
The goal of the soul in this embodiment is to rise from its seat in the Seventh Ray chakra to the level of the solar plexus; here she must deal with her momentums of desire and learn the control of the emotions and the emotional body while dealing with past karmic records. With Mother Mary as her example she must put the moon and her astrology beneath her feet. The path of initiation under one or more of the Ascended Masters wherein she invokes the violet flame to transmute past records and calls to Archangel Michael as her protector is the highest, the safest, and the most expedient road (yoga) leading to reunion with God.
 
Having passed the required tests at the station of the solar plexus, the soul may proceed to her schooling in the heart chakra. Here the lessons to be learned are mercy and compassion; here transmutation of hardness of heart and of what the Buddha calls the unmerciful heart must be accomplished with signs and good works following in service to life. When she is ready the soul may receive the testing of the Inner Buddha and the Inner Christ in the Eighth Ray chakra, the antechamber of the twelve-petaled heart chakra, where the threefold flame burns on the altar and the Inner Buddha is Guru and the Inner Christ is High Priest.
 
And so the age of Aquarius opens the long-awaited age of opportunity for the soul to attain liberation from her karma and the consequent wheel of rebirth. The means of her liberation is the sacred fire, specifically the Seventh Ray aspect of the Holy Spirit, which is the violet flame.
 
Bad karma is the out-of-alignment state that Gautama Buddha called dukkha (suffering). Jesus called it sin. Good karma is alignment with the Word and Work of the Lord, your I AM Presence. Good karma is made by sending forth light vibes, good energy, good deeds, thoughts, and feelings through each of the seven chakras. You make good karma on the Second Ray of Cosmic Christ illumination and Buddhic enlightenment, for instance, by a scientific exercise of wisdom through the crown chakra, by a discriminating and compassionate application of intelligence and the native genius of your Christ mind toward the upliftment of humanity.
 
So, what prevents us from going right up into the plane of the causal body and the I AM Presence, just as Moses went up Mount Horeb to meet his God? What puts the lead weights in our shoes and ties us to the concrete of planet earth with all of the burdens of the age?
 
And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
 
And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
 
Now let us look again at the
