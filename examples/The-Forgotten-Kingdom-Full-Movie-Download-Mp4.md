Possible approaches to solving the curse also form around the characters. These characters in the story are also, at the same time, people who should not be greeted carelessly or with the wrong words. However, if you have the knowledge about these characters, you can not only prevent deadly confrontation, but also get powerful support against the other characters if necessary.
 
As with the core characters, these characters can be confronted with their humanity and thus freed from their madness. In the style of Dark Souls, they will be able to pass on more information in cryptic form, but also be helpful themselves for healing some of the core characters.

Since the characters are the key players and Embers is written in a system-neutral way, there is a section on the **abilities** of the character. For example, the Reaper of Ash can collect souls to transfer them from this world to the next.
 
The **relationships** between the other characters are also presented in each description of a core or major character and explained with their own paragraphs. What is unfortunately missing is a relationship network. This would have been very clever to add to the texts.
 
Each character also possesses less than a handful of **unique equipment**, which, similar to **abilities**, are described in a system-neutral and brief manner. In the case of our Reaper, this is the **Shadow Shroud**, which allows her to move back and forth between shadows.
 
The conclusion is formed by the again somewhat longer, but helpful texts about **Roleplaying the Character** and **Using the Character in the Story**. These sections provide guidance to the game master on how to portray the character when the player characters encounter them.
 
These locations complement well the feel of Soulsborne games. For example, the Royal Mausoleum is described as a huge place of the dead and their rest. On the other hand, inside is also a labyrinth leading to the individual chambers of the local rulers.
 
But Embers also introduces exciting ideas, like the black magic enthusiastic **Brachyura**. Crab-like creatures who like to discuss black magic and the nature of the universe, come up with esoteric theories, and dislike being interrupted in their thoughts. On their bodies they have noted their theses and rituals, so they have to work in circles with each other to discuss and read them out.
 
As with the characters, the locations follow a consistent structure. Ember Castle has the largest portion, 16 pages, and all other locations are described for about 12 pages. As an example we will use the Royal Mausoleum.
 
A low wail echoes from the dark halls of the Royal Mausoleum. Two large steel gates, curved into the symbols of winter and summer, stand ajar. The faint scent of dried flesh and death wafts through their bars, and inside, in the empty halls of forgotten princes and princesses, something yet lives, lurks, scratches, and moans.
 
Each site of Embers has a **section on the history** of the place. This is followed by the **points of interest** of the site, as well as the **characters within the site**. In the case of the mausoleum, for example, this includes a **camp of brigands** as well as the **chainman**. This former knight was shackled in chains and locked in the mausoleum to rot. These characters can also take on a "boss" character from the video game series, but do not necessarily have to be such characters.
 
After that, the sub-locations of the place already follow. In the same style, background, interesting places, notable characters and opportunities are described here. In the case of the mausoleum, this brings more information about the Sunken Cloister, the Tomb of the Would be Kings, and the Ghost Heart, which are individual sections that make this setting grow into a massive place.
 
I own Embers of the Forgotten Kingdom in a leather bound format with gold foil printing. The book is beautiful with glossy paper that highlights the high quality illustrations. The layout is thematically appropriate and not cluttered. Sections are short, concise, and provide an easy structure for re-reading and recalling specific sections.
 
In the back, the collected 56 characters, not only core and major characters, but also those described within the settings, are broken down into two pages with their page reference, motivation, and in which location they can be found.
 
In the companion for Shadow of the Demon Lord, there are new paths. Paths in Shadow of the Demonlord can be compared to small modular classes from Dungeons and Dragons. Also, the stats of the core and major characters are in the work. Each of the core characters also has several phases and tactics in combat. The final part contains stats for possible encounters within the sites. For the price, a useful addition to the book. Gladly such additional volumes will also appear for the other systems. Thus, one can fall back on prefabricated character options and necessary game stats of the characters.
 
I for one like Embers on several levels. The book strongly describes the world and the drama of the summer curse from a network of relationships. The story to be played is strongly influenced by the stopped cycle. Still, it does not have to be the focus of the campaign. It can also play a subordinate role and rather form the framework.
 
Every game system has its kind of story it wants to tell. Therefore, it seems a smart move that Embers is written in a system-neutral way. The necessary game materials for the system are provided with the supplements. Thus, everyone can decide for themselves whether Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder provides the appropriate rules core for this setting.
 
Even if your favorite system got no supplement, you can probably easily recreate the characters yourself and design them as part of your preparation. There are fewer than 10 core and major characters, and the encounters within the setting can certainly be mapped with creatures from the respective rulebooks.
 
So I came up with this idea out of this theory. Nintendo ARE planning on making more games for the Adult Timeline. I think it would be rather dumb continuing on from a land in which is different from the one we know, so this is how it goes:
 
About 300-700 years after Spirit Tracks, we have a topography vastly different from the one in Twilight Princess, but one that is kind of the same. The forest realm, desert/ocean realm and fire ream are given the ancient names of Faron Woods, Lanayru Desert/Ancient Sea and Eldin Volcano out of a dream from Chancellor Cole's heir at that time. He thought he could have evidence to back it up, but didn't really, but named these places as such anyway. There is a new Hyrule Field, and Snow Peak on the top of a mountain in Faron.
 
So Link is an Adult in this game, and has the Zelda U graphics (as opposed to Hyrule Warriors). Link lives in Aboda Village in Faron, which has grown but is dying. He works as a salesman at the local store. He gets in invite to meet Chancellor Cole (this time, he is a GOOD incarnation, and doesn't wear 2 hats) and Princess Zelda. They fear that Malladus may be arising from the dead, so Cole and Zelda give link 1 of the ancient triangle thingos in Spirit Tracks, and Link must find the other 3 to reveal the location of the Lokomo Sword in the ruins of the Tower of Spirits.
 
He does this, and draws the sword, and Malladus in his beast form arises. Link tries to kill him but the Lokomo Sword no longer works for him. Now, there is only 1 more hope, and it is the Legend of the Forgotten kingdom, and a "so called" fictional character called "the Hero of Winds". Since the Zoras have migrated to New Hyrule, he can get something to dive underwater, far away and locate the ruins of the Temple of Time, and can see a stone statue with a source of darkness arising from a sword in his head.
 
Link needs to find the 5 shards of the triforce, one located near the ToT. Once acquiring the other 4 in New Hyrule (a prequel can explain how they got there) Link can draw the Master Sword, but when he returns, Malladus successfully revives Ganon from the dead. The Master Sword, although still fully purified, cannot defeat either of the foes, so Link must forge the magic out of the Lokomo Sword (Which retains it's magic?) to kill the 2 foes. Malladus eventually gets sealed in the sword, and Ganon is too. The Master Sword is returned to the Lokomo Pedestal in the ruins of the ToS, and the Lokomo Sword is passed on from generation to generation by Link.
 
The Forgotten Kingdom is a full dungeon in the game, and houses the Master Sword. After this, not much is heard of the FK until the flood is drained games later. The game is called Forgotten Kingdom because lot's of people tell stories and rumours about it.
 
Forest Sanctuary - Ruins of the Forest Temple in Spirit Tracks. Holds the Green Spirit Gem. It has many components similar to the Spirit Tracks Temple, but to be different, the dungeon item is the first sword.
 
Lanayru Mining and Research Co - A huge facility, similar to the Lanayru Mining Facility in Skyward Sword, but is a different dungeons, and completely different in structure. It holds the Blue Spirit Gem. The dungeon item is the bow.
 
Sacred Shrine - Requires Iron Boots. Found after using the ancient portal in Lanayru Sea, to get to the Great Sea. The Forgotten Kingdom is uninhabited, and is an obstacle to get to the sacred shrine. The dungeon item is the clawshots, and the reward for finishing is the ancient spear, an item which shatters the ba
