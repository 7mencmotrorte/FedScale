I was in my way to upgrade my PA-460 from the version 10.2.3-h9 to 11.2.0, i tried to use the Validate button, to take a look at the upgrade path, but i can't see any result, but i still have my doubts,
 
I'm not sure if you can go straight from 10.2.X to 11.2.X, that said with 11.2.0 being newly released is there a particular reason why you're going to 11.2.0? The code is probably no where near ready for a production deployment.
 
We contacted the Google Workspace team and they helped us to make the transition to Business Standard, making us an offer which appeared in the reseller console. After this we closed the Starter plan.

when you are on fixed term plan (Yearly Payment plan), plan upgrade option is not available, since you already paid for annual term. This is the reason why your annual term plan domain is not showing upgrade option.
 
Your domain might not be converted yet to Pooled storage model, hence the mail box is not having more than 30GB, even after you provisioned storage to 60GB.

Pooled storage process is still going on and it may be implemented to your account as well any time soon. Similar issues are being faced by many since the implementation of pooled storage is still going on and it is taking time as the process should cover thousands of domains.
 
I might be mistaken but I dont think you can run mismatching versions in a VC in any circumstance, so you'd need to upgrade both members for them to form a VC again.
So you'd need to upgrade and reboot both members (and while ISSU is a thing, unless you really need to, I wouldnt really recommend that for upgrades typically, and especially with such big version leaps you'll probably want to be careful and test beforehand).

As for the "3 versions", while that is not a thing anymore, it is referring to main releases (so the "13" in 13.2X51-D26.2 for example could then upgrade to a 16.x version).
So your 18.2R3.4 could safely upgrade to anything up to a 21.x release following the "3 releases" logic. While it is no longer a requirement, there is always a question of how much changed and how big is the risk of things breaking, so I would highly recommend testing the upgrade path in a lab environment to be sure, especially if you are jumping ahead more than 2-3 main releases.

So in conclusion, while technically it might no longer be a thing, and it was never a hard law, I would recommend being very careful with version leaps that go over 3 main releases ahead in version and to be sure to test these beforehand. The (relatively) safe path is to upgrade to the last subrelease (typically x.4R3 or so) in your current train and then jump to the main release you want (20.4R3-S1, though I've heard S2 is coming out in a week or so, so depending on your need you might want to wait and take that one).
 
This path will take more time of course but if you're upgrading production it's probably better to be safe when doing these big version leaps.

Having said that, I think the risk is probably less pronounced with EX-series switches, due to a lesser complexity of features being available than in the MX routers for example, so the risk is probably relatively smaller there.
 
I have upgraded STM32CubeIDE to V1.15. It is asking me to upgrade the firmware in the ST-Link. Going through the upgrade process, it fails stating "Unexpected flash size for ST-Link micro. Don't know how to upgrade".
 
I have been having the same issues; since then a lot of my programs can't flash onto the board and the behaviour of the ST-LINK is very weird. When I open up a program on debugger during the rare-times it does work there is no uart output and some programs when I flash fail
 
It seems V1.15 has more problems, i was working on a project the upgrade was ready i closed the project and did the upgrade. Then went back to my project. Now i cannot download my code for debugging, getting some very odd error message. Screen shot attached. I can still connect to the hardware using STM32CubeProgrammer no problem.
 
Currently, egdb is on 10.8.1 on a SQL Server 2019, Enterprise deployment (server/portal clients) are on 11.1. All desktop users are using Pro 3.2, with a few exceptions that have been tough to completely pull away from ArcMap. From what I understand, it isn't inherently bad to have different egdb and client versions, though it is recommended to keep them in step. I was reading about upgrading egdb and came across this article: Upgrade Enterprise Geodatabase in SQL Server In particular, this passage caught my eye:
 
"When you upgrade a geodatabase in SQL Server to 11.0 or a later release, the fully qualified names of tables and feature classes will no longer contain the database name. For example, a feature class named productdata.dataowner.inventory in a 10.9.x geodatabase will be named dataowner.inventory after you upgrade the geodatabase."
 
This seems very important, but I'm wondering what the knock-on consequences of this change are. For example, if I have web services that contain a feature class joined to a table, will the removal of the database name affect the join? Any other concerns that I should be aware of but can't see? Finally, any other issues you may have run into upgrading your egdb? This will be my first time going through the process.
 
There used to be prescriptive documentation for version support, so 10.8.1 clients could work with 10.2.1 EGDBs for example, and then you got the list of supported databases and drivers. Yes, it's a complex mix.
 
Always we have to look at the lowest common denominator. I have a client that uses a third-party tool that is an addin to ArcMap, it only works on 10.6.1, so the EGDBs and a single ArcMap version are 'held back' to that version. Everything else comes up above it. The same client has more modern workflows, which need Pro and more recent versions. So, they hold the databases that they must back to 10.6.1 and then use other geodatabases that support the modern workflows.
 
You suggested that your situation is inherently bad, I'd say it's almost typical. I've seen far worse. In terms of the more modern functions like Parcel Fabrics, UNM, Branch Versioning, I'd be recommending to stay as close to latest as possible. But if your using simple types, or things that have been with us for ages, then it's not 'inherently bad'. It could be better, but your constrained by ArcMap by the sounds of it. Be aware that ArcMap can connect to higher versions, but there could be things in there that it doesn't understand because the ArcMap code base doesn't support those concepts/functions, and so you may get some weirdness.
 
So, look at your lowest common denominator and make sure you can work around that. That sounds like ArcMap. I won't lecture. Then try and come up as close to current as you can for anything and everything else. Instead of good bad, you could end up with most of your geodatabases in a modern version, and those that you must hold back as older. So instead of black/white, you end up (hopefully) light grey.
 
SQL Server has been an issue for years in that the geodatabase version had the database name held in the SDE tables. This meant that if you had one SQL Server, you couldn't duplicate the geodatabase and use it for testing and a myriad of other functions. It also made it impossible to rename the database and things like that. The new approach is awesome and one of the best things Esri have done in this space. I haven't used it in anger, but I would assume it would break your connections from older versions, I'd 'guess' that ArcMap won't support it. You will almost certainly need to replace SDE files and data stores in Enterprise, so yes a degree of reworking, but the new flexibilities it offers means it's worth the effort.
