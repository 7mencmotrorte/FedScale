The encrypted/scrambled digital channels (DVB-T, DVB-C and DVB-S) can be decoded by either a Conditional Access Module (CAM or CI-Module) with a smart card or by a Set top box depending on the implementation by the service provider.
 
You may have inserted the CAM in the wrong orientation. If the CAM is inserted correctly, a prompt will appear on-screen that the CAM is connected and the [**Common interface**] menu will be highlighted in the options menu.

DVB-S stands for Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite and it is the standard for broadcasting a TV signal over the satellite. This system transmits digital audio and video signals in the MPEG format. DVB-S2 is an enhancement of DVB-S which improves the efficiency and reliability of the broadcast channels.
 
Your TV has an integrated DVB-S2 tuner that is backward compatible with DVB-S, which enables you to view free satellite channels from the service provider. In order to view the encrypted/scrambled channels you need either a Conditional Access Module (CAM or CI-Module) with a smart card or a Set top box depending on the implementation by the service provider.

So when you select DVBC (or before) you have to go to digital settings and choose fully
