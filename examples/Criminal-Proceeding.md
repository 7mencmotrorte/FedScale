Below are links to the national federal rules and forms in effect, as well as local rules (which are required to be consistent with the national rules) prescribed by district courts and courts of appeal.
 
The Rules of Procedure for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court were promulgated pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1803(g). They govern all proceedings in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and were last amended in 2010.
 
United States district courts and courts of appeals often prescribe local rules governing practice and procedure. Such rules must be consistent with both Acts of Congress and the Federal Rules of Practice and Procedure, and may only be prescribed after notice and an opportunity for public comment. A court's authority to prescribe local rules is governed by both statute and the Federal Rules of Practice and Procedure. See 28 U.S.C. 2071(a)-(b); Fed. R. App. P. 47; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9029; Fed. R. Civ. P. 83; Fed. R. Crim. P. 57.
 
Section 205 of the E-Government Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, requires that federal courts post local rules on their websites. Visit the Federal Court Finder for a listing of all federal court websites.
 
The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCP) are a set of rules that govern the procedures followed in criminal cases within the federal court system of the United States. These rules were established to ensure the fair and efficient administration of justice in federal criminal proceedings. The FRCP were first adopted by the Supreme Court in 1944 and have since undergone revisions to adapt to the changing legal landscape.

The primary objective of the FRCP, as stated in Rule 1, is to ensure the just determination of every criminal proceeding. The rules are designed to promote simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and the elimination of unnecessary expenses and delays. These principles are essential to safeguarding the rights and interests of individuals accused of crimes.
 
The FRCP covers various stages of a criminal case, starting from the initial investigation to trial, sentencing, and appeals. It ensures that the rights of defendants, as enshrined in the United States Constitution, are protected throughout the process. The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments play a significant role in shaping the rules governing criminal procedure. These amendments protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures, ensure the right against self-incrimination, guarantee the right to counsel, and prohibit cruel and unusual punishment.
 
The FRCP emphasizes the importance of due process, equal treatment, and the protection of constitutional rights. It ensures that defendants are informed of the charges against them, have access to relevant evidence, and are provided an opportunity to present their case. By establishing rules for arrest warrants, initial appearances, and bail conditions, the FRCP ensures that the rights of the accused are respected from the very beginning of the criminal process.
 
On 31 March 2017, France filed preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Court and the admissibility of the Application, and the proceedings on the merits were suspended. Having held public hearings in February 2018, on 6 June 2018 the Court delivered its Judgment on the preliminary objections raised by France. In its Judgment, the Court upheld the first preliminary objection raised by France, according to which it lacked jurisdiction on the basis of Article 35 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. However, it found that it had jurisdiction, on the basis of the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, to entertain the Application of Equatorial Guinea in so far as it concerned the status of the building located at 42 avenue Foch in Paris as premises of the mission, and that this part of the Application was admissible.
 
**Criminal procedure** is the adjudication process of the criminal law. While criminal procedure differs dramatically by jurisdiction, the process generally begins with a formal criminal charge with the person on trial either being free on bail or incarcerated, and results in the conviction or acquittal of the defendant. Criminal procedure can be either in form of inquisitorial or adversarial criminal procedure.[1]
 
Countries using the common law tend to make a clear distinction between civil and criminal procedures. For example, an English criminal court may force a convicted accused to pay a fine to the Crown as punishment for the crime, and sometimes to pay the legal costs of the prosecution, but does not normally order the convicted accused to pay any compensation to the victim of the crime. The victim must pursue their claim for compensation in a civil, not a criminal, action.[2] In countries using the continental civil law system, such as France and Italy, the victim of a crime (known as the "injured party") may be awarded damages by a criminal court judge.
 
The standards of proof are higher in a criminal action than in a civil one since the loser risks not only financial penalties but also being sent to prison (or, in some countries, execution). In English law the prosecution must prove the guilt of a criminal "beyond reasonable doubt"; but the plaintiff in a civil action is required to prove his case "on the balance of probabilities".[2] "Beyond reasonable doubt" is not defined for the jury which decides the verdict, but it has been said by appeal courts that proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt requires the prosecution to exclude any reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence: *Plomp v. R*. In a civil case, however, the court simply weighs the evidence and decides what is most probable.
 
Criminal and civil procedure are different. Although some systems, including the English, allow a private citizen to bring a criminal prosecution against another citizen, criminal actions are nearly always started by the state. Civil actions, on the other hand, are usually started by individuals.
 
Evidence given at a criminal trial is not necessarily admissible in a civil action about the same matter, just as evidence given in a civil cause is not necessarily admissible on a criminal trial. For example, the victim of a road accident does not directly benefit if the driver who injured him is found guilty of the crime of careless driving. He still has to prove his case in a civil action.[2] In fact he may be able to prove his civil case even when the driver is found not guilty in the criminal trial. If the accused has given evidence on his trial he may be cross-examined on those statements in a subsequent civil action regardless of the criminal verdict.
 
Proponents of either system tend to consider that their system defends best the rights of the innocent. There is a tendency in common law countries to believe that civil law / inquisitorial systems do not have the so-called "presumption of innocence", and do not provide the defence with adequate rights. Conversely, there is a tendency in countries with an inquisitorial system to believe that accusatorial proceedings unduly favour rich defendants who can afford large legal teams, and therefore disfavour poorer defendants.
 
These rules govern the procedure in all criminal proceedings in the magistrate courts of the State of West Virginia. These rules supplement, and in designated instances supersede, the statutory procedures set forth in Chapter 50 and Chapter 62 of the West Virginia Code.
 
These rules are intended to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding. They shall be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.
 
The complaint shall be presented to and sworn or affirmed before a magistrate in the county where the offense is alleged to have occurred. Unless otherwise provided by statute, the presentation and oath or affirmation shall be made by a prosecuting attorney or a law enforcement officer showing reason to have reliable information and belief. If from the facts stated in the complaint the magistrate finds probable cause, the complaint becomes the charging instrument initiating a criminal proceeding.
 
If the offense is to be presented for indictment, a defendant is entitled to a preliminary examination unless waived. If the defendant waives preliminary examination, the magistrate clerk shall transmit forthwith to the clerk of the circuit court all papers in the proceeding. The magistrate court clerk shall also transmit to the prosecuting attorney a copy of the criminal case history sheet. Thereafter, the proceeding shall remain within the jurisdiction of the circuit court and shall not be remanded to the magistrate. If the defendant does not waive the preliminary examination, the magistrate shall schedule a preliminary examination. Such examination shall be held within a reasonable time but in any event not later than 10 days following the initial appearance if the defendant is in custody and no later than 20 days if the defendant is not in custody; provided, however, that the preliminary examination shall not be held if the defendant is indicted or if an information aga
