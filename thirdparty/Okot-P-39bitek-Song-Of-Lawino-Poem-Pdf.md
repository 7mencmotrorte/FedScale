"Song of Lawino" shares with most oral epic the large scale form of anextended narrative poem. It is not an example of oral traditional epic, in thatit was composed by an single individual about a subject contemporary to thatwriter rather than looking back to an heroic age. It does, however, borrow someof the stylistic surface feature of oral poetry. It is composed in a simplerhythmic structure appropriate for public performance, uses repeated epithets,invokes stereotypes, and is structured agglutinatively, creating effects not bysubordination and analysis but by piling on layers of detail. Also like mostoral poetry, it is close to the human life world and makes its point viastriking example rather than abstraction.
