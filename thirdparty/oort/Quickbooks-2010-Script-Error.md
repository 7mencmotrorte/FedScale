QuickBooks uses Internet Explorer (IE) to download updates, as well as to display many of the windows in the program. Thus, you'll need to have IE as the default browser and updated to the latest version (Internet Explorer 11).

It seems odd to me that I have been using Google Chrome as my default browser for years now (not to mention, Google Chrome is the preferred browser by Intuit for QuickBooks Online). I have never seen this Script error until today when opening a clients file on my desktop (it happens to be QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions 2020. Coincidentally, I just received a phone call from a long time client who is getting the identical script error and his just started today. This client is using QB Premier 2017. If that's not enough, I just remoted into a clients computer to resolve an issue with DB File Fragments and low and behold, they are getting the same script error. This client is using QBES 2013. What the heck is going on? Is December 20th national script error day?
 
This error is usually caused by an in-product message that was activated. Clicking on Yes to the message will dismiss it and allow you to continue working without issues. Rest assured that our engineers are now working to resolve this as quickly as possible.
 
To stay updated with the status of this investigation, I recommend contacting our Support Team so you'll be added to the list of affected users and automatically receive an email notification with the latest updates. Or, visit this site: Script error when opening QuickBooks Desktop for Windows.
 
Our engineering team is currently gathering data to get this resolved as early as possible. If you're already added to the list of affected users in this investigation, you'll automatically be notified of the updates. If not, check out this link:

In QuickBooks on the menu bar click **HELP>Internet Connection Setup>Next>Advanced Connection Setting>Security (tab)>Restricted Sites>Sites**. In the "Add this website to the zone:" paste or type url address the error message is complaining about, such as uxfabric.intuitcdn.net, as an example. Click **Add>Close>OK>Done**.
 

This can be used for all script error messages when opening QuickBooks. I have encountered several. They all seem to be connected to "User Experience Enhancement" (aka User Tracking) that are not functioning correctly. Blocking them does not affect the software....other than to block some pop-up ads Intuit may try to send.
 
I know, you are working on it. I just wanted to add, for the record, that all of our users in-house were notified of an update waiting and they applied it. That is when the script error started. I'm not sure when this particular update was released, but the problem is still not fixed. Hopefully, it is not serious.
 
In addition, I just want to say, whoever is saying Edge must be the default browser in order for QB to work correctly needs to stop it. We've been using Chrome for years. It is an integral part of our company (We use Google for almost everything). We've NEVER had to, or been told to, use Edge. Clearly someone needs to update the info Intuit is passing on to customers.
 
Since you continue to encounter the same result, I encourage you to get in touch with our QuickBooks Desktop Technical Support Team. They have additional tools to process other troubleshooting steps and investigate this further.
 
I don't see how setting my default browser to IE11 will fix this. These scripts errors have come and gone for years and you can see it by searching other threads. This happens because QB insists on pulling in script files for advertising even though you've already paid for a desktop copy. That in itself isn't the cause, but I'm sure QB developers know what the cause is. Seems one script error will pop up, they'll fix it, and a new come appears a few days afterwards when they decide to update their script files.
 
The reason why you need to set Internet Explorer (IE) as the default browser is that QuickBooks uses this to download updates. Additionally, the Script Error prompt happens when the settings of the default browser are incorrect or misconfigured.
 
If you already performed the troubleshooting steps shared by my colleagues above and the issue persists, I highly suggest contacting our Phone Support team so they can check your account using their screen-sharing (remote access) tool in a secure environment. They are also able to perform other troubleshooting to fix this for you.
 
The script is due to some pushed in-product messages. Our engineers told us that it will just be resolved by itself, so we don't have any troubleshooting steps as of now. I've checked the status of the investigation about this error and found out it was already closed.

**Conclusion:**  
By addressing script issues in QuickBooks, it encourages a more dependable and effective experience with QuickBooks, allowing users to concentrate on their financial activities without being distracted by script errors.
 
We are experiencing a Script error while running Quickbooks Desktop Pro 2021. It started about 2 weeks ago. Here is the script error message : Line: 68, Char: 54, Error: Expected ')', Code:0. This is very annoying. How do I get rid of this message?
 
IE is not a great browser. I use Firefox and I do not want to set IE as my default. I have not had this problem before with IE not set as my default browser. We bought the 2021 version in January and the issue only started two weeks ago, plus my browser has always been Firefox. Why is this happening now? I have entered the \*.intuit as a trusted site in IE. I changed the rest of what you mentioned but I still have the problem. Is there a patch or anything else I can do besides setting IE as my default browser?
 
If the issue persists, I'd suggest contacting our QuickBooks Support Team. They can have this further checked and investigated. They're also equipped with tools that'll help us determine the main cause of this error.
 
I've gone through all of these steps and still getting the script errors - I event reinstalled QB. One of the errors shows this URL: -mpulse.net/boomerang/AEN8U......there are about 4 errors that pop up before I can get started working in QB.
 
Since the issue persists after following all the necessary troubleshooting shared by my peers on this thread, I'd suggest contacting our QuickBooks Support team to help us determine the main cause of this error.
 
However if you're still encountering the script errors, I would recommend contacting our support at this point. They'll check your script error files and help you resolve them. Here's how to reach them:
 
I have the same issue, starting about a week ago, and am running desktop version 2013. No updates are available but it has been working fine. I use Chrome as my browser, do not have IE installed, unless that is what Edge is now.
 
Since this is happening on different versions of Quickbooks my guess is that its caused by a Microsoft update. With Microsoft's recent announcements regarding end of support for IE and Edge updates designed to completely take over from IE by running IE mode inside of Edge its likely that an error has been inadvertently introduced by a recent Win10/Edge update.
 
Setting IE as a default browser is unacceptable, and is forbidden for all CMMC Level 1 and above compliant companies. This browser is end-of-life and nearly all DoD contractor IT departments forbid its use or installation. Intuit needs to come up with a better solution - either make the product compliant with a standard browser that is usable by DoD contractors or permit QuickBooks to be run in a VM or sandbox.
 
I just had some success with this error this morning, combining a few suggestions found here. In my opinion, it's partly QB problem and partly a MS update issue. What I did that worked in my case was:
 
1) Edit the windows host file (found in C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc) to include the domains displayed in each of the error messages shown when opening and closing the program. For me, the below lines are what I added to the bottom of the file, but the domains may be different for you..
 
Currently, QuickBooks Desktop requires Internet Explorer 11 (32-bit). You'll want to look for a third-party application that you can integrate so that you can run it on VM or Sandbox. If you're a developer, you can visit for further assistance.
 
Actually, I've just butted heads with IT. Can't use IE even in a sandbox or VM. You're going to find this issue with every single defense contractor in the coming months. If IE is the tool required to maintain updates, then this means that we can't even keep the product updated with security patches. This is wholly unacceptable. Please note - as required by law, I am filing a vulnerability report with the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Once they have reviewed, Quickbooks will likely be listed as vulnerable, resulting in automatic removal from the computers of most US defense contractors. The timeframe for this type of event is usually days not weeks. Urge you to contact developers ASAP to correct defect.
 
These are the standard solutions that your leadership provides to give customers.

The root issue is these script errors are coming from the
