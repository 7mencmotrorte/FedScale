LSAC requires that every student who wants to use a prep course that uses real LSAT questions must have an active LSAC Prep Plus subscription. That includes us, 7Sage, and any other LSAT prep course that uses real LSAT questions.

Without an LSAC Prep Plus subscription, you won't be able to access parts of our Ultimate+ subscription course that show the licensed materials including the PrepTests and explanation videos. I'm afraid this is LSAC policy and we don't have a say in this.
 
Note that you only need one LSAC Prep Plus subscription no matter how many prep courses you use. That means that if you use prep courses from multiple companies, you don't need to purchase multiple LSAC Prep Plus accounts. You can use the same one.

The New Concrete Prep-Plus Tool is an aggressive, semi-rigid, 25 grit diamond grinding tool for use on smooth concrete floors. This tool easily profiles and prepares concrete floors for the application of high-build coatings or flooring systems. The Prep-Plus Tools feature stiff but still flexible metal blades that cut faster and flatter than the original prep tools. The aggressive 25 grit diamonds are perfect for preparing surfaces for epoxy, flake and quartz floors. If you are planning to stain the concrete or apply a clear sealer, be sure to follow this tool with one of the 100 grit tools to remove any scratches or swirls left by the more aggressive 25 grit diamonds.
 
The Prep-Plus Tools cut faster and can last up to twice as long as the original Prep Tools. Typical blade life of the Prep-Plus Tool averages between 15,000 - 25,000 sq. ft. Wet-grinding is always recommended if possible, as water will keep the diamonds cooler and substantially increase their life. The Prep-Plus Tool is available in 12"-20" sizes.

The Diamabrush system is an extremely affordable and effective way to prepare and profile concrete floors for the application of dye, stain, sealer and epoxy. These tools are easy to use, require no special training and fit most all standard floor machines available at most rental stores.
 
To ensure the tool you order is a perfect fit for your specific machine and set-up, we custom build each tool per order. This allows us to ship most Diamabrush orders NEXT DAY, and of course shipping is always free to most states!
 
Above are two excellent videos explaining how the prep tools work and how to use them most effectively. The first one is actually a training video made specifically for associates in the Home Depot rental department.
 
Once you have this information, open the Machine Reference Guide above. The machine manufacturers are listed in alphabetical order. Once your brand of machine is found, continue down until you find the correct model. By reading across, you can then determine the correct clutch plate required for your specific machine. Disregard the "brush sizes" and "pad driver sizes listed in the reference guide, they are for other applications. If possible, please include your machine make and model in the "Machine Make / Model" section of the order form. This is not required, but it is very helpful to our technicians when assembling your new tool.
 
For most Diamabrush applications, the tool block diameter should be ordered 2" smaller than the stated machine size if you wish for the tool to fit up inside the housing of the machine. If you wish for your new tool to extend all the way to the edge of your machine housing, you will need a riser to allow the desired diameter tool to drop below the housing and extend outwards toward or past the edge of the machine housing. A riser is a just a simple spacer that is mounted between the clutch plate and tool. You will have the option of including a riser when you select your required clutch plate.
 
Either way is acceptable and there are pros and cons to each. A tool that fits up inside the machine housing, without a riser allows for a lower center of gravity and also makes the tool much less vulnerable to damage. On the other hand, a riser allows for a larger tool that will cover more area and allows you to grind all the way up against walls and other stationary objects. We usually recommend ordering your tool 2 inches smaller than the stated size of your machine and installing it without a riser, but the choice is up to you to decide which setup is best for your application. If you do choose to use a riser and order a larger tool, be very careful not to allow the diamond blades to impact stationary objects.
 
The Concrete Prep-Plus Tool is available in both clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations. Machine rotation is easily determined by looking straight down at the machine as it sits on the floor, and simply noting the direction of rotation. The majority of machines on the market today have a counter-clockwise rotation. If the Machine Reference Guide specifies the standard NP-9200 clutch plate for your machine, then it is a counter-clockwise rotation. If the Machine Reference Guide specifies a different clutch plate for your machine, you will need to determine the direction of rotation.
 
Diamabrush Tools are available with a variety of different diameter center holes, as well as with no hole at all. Once again, the specifications for center hole sizes can be found in the Machine Reference Guide. The majority of machines on the market today require a standard 5" diameter center hole for mounting of the standard NP-9200 clutch plate. If you need a different, or specific size center hole, or desire a solid tool with no center hole, be sure to include that information in the "Additional Tool Notes" section of the order form.

The program implemented in the fall of 2012, challenges the high achieving academic student in a rigorous math and English/Language Arts curriculum that engages in critical thinking, problem solving, and acceleration.
 
The Prep and Prep+ math and English/Language Arts curriculum were developed over the course of two years of research and data analysis by a committee of advanced English and math teachers, school administrators, and district consultants, under the direction of Tara Drysdale, Assistant Superintendent.
 
The goal is to provide high achieving students content acceleration in English/ Language Arts and math to prepare them for advanced placement and dual credit courses while in high school. The rigorous curriculum will enhance their university entrance and potential scholarship opportunities.
 
For more information about the Prep and Prep+ Acceleration Program, please contact the school principal at the elementary level and the school principal or counselor at the middle and high school level.
