I am looking for an official way to verify that a product key that I have will activate a particular Windows 11 edition. I want to either run a command or send a request to a Microsoft API that will tell me if a key will work without actually using it to activate Windows on the host machine.
 
You should first know that Microsoft provides no service to verify theauthenticity of the Windows Product Key, but no legal responsibilityis assumed for you if Windows was activated through a stolen product key.

The fact that your Windows is activated and its serial key was acceptedby the Microsoft activation servers, and re-verified on each boot,is already a good sign. If your serial is used in parallel on anothercomputer, Windows will deactivate it on your computer.
 
I haven't tried it yet, but I quoted its original makers to clarify the OP (@JeremyEastham) doubt whether it may or not work. Indeed, you would have to specify the Activation ID parameter for that command to work. If, @JeremyEastham has already, unsuccessfully, tried that full command (with the additional argument) then Microsoft should be notified of this anomaly.
 
Since these calculators are products used as educational tools for long periods of time, materials that ensure robust key durability and prevent wear or fading of key markings are used to ensure product quality.
 
Counterfeits consume 5 to 10 times more electricity! They may also have battery installed different than the designated one, rendering your spares unusable. The genuine products will last longer in operation and are consequently much more economical than counterfeits.

This can come in handy when you get a product into your hand and want to check if it has been previousely registered (and possibly used). Think of third party sellers who may not even know themselves that they are indirectly helping a scheme of reselling used products. And once you open the product packaging as the end user, it is yours, game over. So it would be really good if SanDisk had such a facility to check the warranty status, as other industry players have this (and I could not find it on the sire, apologies if I missed it).
 
you can register the product online. from the link below on the right side select register your product. If you do not have an account you will need to create one then you can register your product. Their system will verify the serial number of the ssd and it will tell you if it has already been registered and or is a valid serial number.
 
But what if you are in a shop or receive it from a third party seller, then you need to check before use, before unpacking, before accepting the product as yours, and such registration makes this innocent check impossible.
 
typically if the drive was shipped in the machine it is sold as OEM and the machine manufacturer is responsible for the warranty. it sounds like you are in a bit of a unique situation as the machine is a non SSD part number host machine. you can try contacting sandisk support and see if they can work with you on the warranty or go back to amazon as the product you purchased was not as described. amazon has great customer service and may take care of the issue for you.
