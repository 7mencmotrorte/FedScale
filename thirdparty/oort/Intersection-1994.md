While maintaining the semblance of a marriage with his wife, Sally, Vincent has been carrying on with a mistress, Olivia. She's everything Sally isn't -- warm, passionate, carefree. So why can't he choose between the two, especially when his indecision is taking its toll on his daughter?

Originally adapted from the 1970s French film & novel, Les Choses de la Vie (The Things In Life), Intersection is a U.S remake set in Vancouver, Canada; architect Vincent Eastman is married to his wife, Sally and they have a child, but who is also having an affair with another woman, a magazine writer. He is tormented by the struggle of choosing between the two.
 
Of note, Jennifer Morrison, who went on to star in the Fox hit medical drama, House plays the young daughter of Vincent and Sally's in Megahan and the film's test market screenings had two erotic sex scenes between Gere and Davidovich, but these were eventually (and sadly) edited out.
 
Intersection begins with a scene that happens about fifteen minutes from the end and the film jumps back and forth in time for the duration. It gets a bit difficult to know when everything's happening when a scene begins, but for the most part the time jumps don't hurt the story. Except the very beginning. It's pretty clear from that scene how the film's going to resolve and that makes the rest of it kind of unnecessary.
 
The general criticism of the film is fair; Gere's character isn't sympathetic & his life crisis comes from a place of entitlement & egotism. But I found the strange scene in which the character meets what could be himself as an old man (complete with a granddaughter modeled on his mistress) to be so fascinating & quietly surreal that it brought together the various themes of the film & elevated the entire third act.

Richard Gere en Sharon Stone. Zo'n combinatie zou toch op zijn minst voor kleine vonkjes moeten zorgen, denk je dan. Dat was allicht ook het gedacht bij Paramount, maar deze film uit 1994 haalde weliswaar een heleboel lijstjes, maar het waren wel n voor n opsommingen van de slechtste films van het jaar. Daar zijn verschillende redenen voor, maar de voornaamste is misschien wel dat je van Franse klassiekers maar beter geen Amerikaanse remake maakt. Deze film van Mark Rydell is immers een "nieuwe" adaptie (lees veramerikanisering) van Les Choses De La Vie uit 1970 van Claude Sautet met Michel Piccoli en Romy Schneider.
 
The story concerns A rich designer (Richard Gere) who is stuck between his gorgeous but unreceptive wife (Sharon Stone) of 16 years and his good-looking lover (Lolita Davidovich). However, things go erratic when he gets into an incident and perishes.
 
I really wish this was better. I like Richard Gere as an actor--maybe more than I should but like I generally tend to buy him in whatever scenario the movie I'm watching presents him in, and I usually find his presence to be a sturdy one even if he's miscast or if the character he's playing is a mess or in utter disarray (which let's be honest, he usually is!) (Viva Dr. T & the Women I say!) There's always the sense to me of a there there so it's probably his presence here that keeps this watchable to me at the very least, but boy is this movie torpid. So very, very, very torpid.
 
Richard Gere and Sharon Stone have made some pretty horrible movies in their day, but this is kind of like a super-amalgam of everything bad about them put together. The acting is terrible, but in way, I can't really fault them for it because the dialogue/script is so abysmal. The plot makes some kind of logical sense, I guess, but it's so inane and pointless that it doesn't really matter. The movie reaches unparalleled heights of cloying melodrama towards the end, but the worst part of all is probably the pretentious visual motif used throughout it. For no apparent reason, the movie keeps jumping to a marble sliding down some kind of Rube-Goldberg machine. What's the deep meaning there? That watching a marble roll down a slide is more entertaining than watching this ridiculous movie?

Bankruptcy has long had unique implications for divorce settlements and debts between ex-spouses. Historically, some marital debts owed from one ex-spouse to another were excepted from the traditional policy of "discharge. " Bankruptcy law distinguished between debts in the nature of alimony, maintenance, and support, which were protected from discharge, and property division debts, which were not. This distinction often had harsh consequences for creditor ex-spouses. Reeently, Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, in part to ameliorate this problem. The amended Bankruptcy Code providP..s better protection for some property division debts. In this Note, Ms. Johnson argues that the new amendments, while certainly a conscientious enhancement of the Bankruptcy Code's previously inadequate protection for marital debts, are in need of clarification. She locates several problems in these new amendments, and recommends specific guidelines to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. Ms. Johnson canvasses legal commentary on the new legislation and suroeys contemporary case law to demonstrate that myriad difficulties exist in the application of the new section 523(a)(15)(B) "balancing test" created lly the Reform Act. She argues that the test encourages excessive flexibility and subjectivity. The "balancing" function is performed with varying degrees of success, and some courts have tended to uphold discharge notwithstanding the possibility of bankruptcy for the creditor ex-spouse. Al5o, nUr merous splits of authority have emerged. Ms. Johnson recommends specific guidelines to clari.fj section 523(a)(15)(B). These standards would remedy current problems of opacity, lack of uniformity, and subjectivity. Implementation of these guidelines would give bankruptcy judges better direction in applying the balancing test, while more effectively realizing Congress's goal: greater protection for marital debts.
 
The new plan will cut off the two streets from what is now a six-way intersection where Garden St., Concord Ave., Follen and Little Concord meet. With the change, that patch of road, which sits in front of the Longy School of Music, will become a more conventional four-way intersection.
 
"I think it's a great idea," Gaudette said. "I think it's a really dangerous intersection. In the three years that I've lived in Currier, I have witnessed several accidents. I think it's long overdue."
 
But several local residents are unhappy about the change. Some believe the closing of the streets and the additional traffic that will have to be rerouted onto Waterhouse St. could make it harder for them to park and exit, according to City Councillor William H. Walsh.Other local residents have complained that the city has not made its plans clear to them.
