Due to mounting license costs, Apple just cannot add every font that users think they should, nor remove the hundreds of fonts that are irrelevant to most of us. LinoType (and MonoType) offer extensive Neue Helvetica Condensed families, but there is no reference to any "roman" member. Also, I do not find any reference to a condensed "roman" hand available for download from any of the free font sites.

It's an Agfa tt font which also has helvetica condensed bold in its family but it conflicts with the apple version. I've tried all ways of disabling the apple version but it's impossible in big sur, even through terminal. I'm really annoyed as I've just bought a new imac and updated my software. I've been a professional mac user since system 6 but the idea of padlocking the fonts is an absolute nightmare for a graphic designer.
 
I am fully conversed with the mounting license costs, I've been buying fonts for the last 30+ years. The roman (regular) version of a font is the most used by professional graphic designers for body copy. I think it's an oversight by apple to not allow fonts to be disabled, especially for professional users. This problem isn't a small one for me, I now have to think a way around this for a 552 page catalogue. I'm not happy, I feel like I've wasted my money buying a new imac and updating my software just to find I can't control my font usage. Apple seem to have forgotten their professional customers, some of whom, like me have been with them since the late 80s.
 
I am wondering if you drop the Agfa Monotype font into your local Library Fonts folder (/Users/username/Library/Fonts), whether you can then visit Font Book and see if it will give you a choice of which duplicate to use? Have a feeling it won't make you happy, though.
 
Font book won't allow any changes to the fonts apple installed. My version of the bold font displays okay but is ignored when outputting the file. I even disabled SIP in terminal to see if I could remove condensed bold but it still wouldn't let me access the fonts.
