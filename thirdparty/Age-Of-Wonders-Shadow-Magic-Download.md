It is my understanding that SM is AoW2 with a whole new story and gameplay, but uses the same engine.I know most of you may suggest starting at the beginning, but if someone asked me where to start with Heroes of Might and Magic, I wouldn't suggest the first game. I would likely tell them just to go right to HoMM 3, as it is a superior game in all respects versus the older ones. Especially if they don't have time to play two 60+ hour games.Let me know your thoughts.Thank you.. **Author** **Replies:** Henrysix

 Member posted 01-28-06 07:59 PM EDT (US) 2 / 20 Shadow Magic (basicly the same game as AoW2 but with a lot of more content, bugfixes, balance improvements, editor tools etc.)If you really want to start from the beginning you should check out AoW1, as that is still a really good game in its own way.

 Member posted 01-28-06 08:51 PM EDT (US) 3 / 20 Thanks.. I figured as much. I am sure AoW1 is excellent, as is Ultima 1, Might and Magic 1, etc, etc, but if I could only play one game in any of those series, I wouldn't likely pick the first ones Every time I try to go back and play those REALLY old games, the nostalgia wears off when I think of the tedium of some of them.Anyhow, thanks again!

Definitely wouldn't bother with AoW2, however... **"Shooting down a plane of civilians isn't careless, it's politcal opportunism." - Stormraider** Zylithan 
 Member posted 01-28-06 09:22 PM EDT (US) 5 / 20 I know sometimes people like to start you at the beginning, and its usually a bad idea. But, honestly really and truly, I think AoW 1 might be the best of the games. BUT, I would recommend getting shadow magic, because the main point for many people is online play, and there's a lot more action in shadow magic. I Love Bananas

 Member posted 01-29-06 12:36 PM EDT (US) 7 / 20 Well, first allow me to say that the three games in the AoW series are somewhat...disconnected...from one another, so starting at the beginning doesn't have the same value it might other games.My advice is to take a look at some of the screenshots of AoW1, and see what you think of the interface. In my opinion, the original game is one of the best - rich, deep storyline and an emphasis on choice make it a lot of fun. What I like best about it is that each scenario feels like a story in itself, rather than just a big pause in the continuity - the way it does in some games.On the other hand, AoW2 and onward are both very nice in themselves. They have superior graphics, longer campaigns, and more content. I've always felt they lacked some depth, but they are both excellent. I would definitely recommend Shadow Magic over The Wizard's Throne here. Unknown250 
 Member posted 01-29-06 05:33 PM EDT (US) 8 / 20 Here's how I rate them:Best: AoW 1. In terms of gameplay and feel, it's much better than the sequels. Graphics, AoW 2 and SM have much better looking graphics, while AoW 1 has a beautiful, hand-drawn feel to it. I guess whichever one I prefer depends on my mood. If you want, just download the AoW 1 demo. It comes with a great scenario, and you'll understand what I'm talking about. The demo should be enough to decide wether you'd like it or not.AoW SM: Better graphics and better mechanics (espescially combatwise, where they add in factors like range, obstacles, and attacks draining movement), but it doesn't have the feel of the original. Let's put it like this: AoW SM was designed to be much shorter than AoW 1. I've always thought of AoW SM as a fantasy game, where I go in and piddle around with some troops for a bit. An online game doesn't take very long (comparatively). On the other hand, AoW 1 is a fantasy *world*, where everything feels big and epic and you can lose yourself for hours. A lot of fun, but good luck playing online!AoW 2: The game that came between AoW 1 and AoW SM, it is inferiour to SM in every single possible way, except maybe Campaign and box art. MitchK1989 
 Member posted 01-30-06 12:05 PM EDT (US) 9 / 20 Shadow magic is by far the best, any possible advantages AoW1 had over it for gameplay are fixed by modding. Dwiggmod + SM is my personal preference, but there's plenty of other mods out there plus the standard ruleset and the UPATCH NTJedi 
 Member posted 01-30-06 01:35 PM EDT (US) 10 / 20 I also prefer AOW:SM... but I really miss the dungeon crawl exploring feature from AOW\_1 when exploring crypts and stuff.**There can be only one.

In terms of atmosphere (music, graphs), I think AoW-sm is close to aow1. The Shadow Magic editor, however, is that much more powerful that when you let go of nostalgia and learn to work with it, Shadow Magic is better.In terms of balance and gameplay, AoW-sm is much better then AoW1.Imo, you cannot really compare AoW-sm to AoW-TWT. In a way, AoW-sm is what AoW-TWT should have been.

Get the unofficial Patch v1.4. here!
My best AoW-Sm map: Drums of Death (This is the multiplayer version; for single player, or AI use different version)
Other proud AoW-sm maps: The Key of Kharzul, The Fight for Light, Waikiti Island, Goldrush Mountains

 Member posted 01-30-06 10:31 PM EDT (US) 12 / 20 "In terms of balance and gameplay, AoW-sm is much better then AoW1."I disagree. While SM is more balanced than AoW 1, it's not a huge deal, as the only really gaping flaws in AoW 1's balance were the dragons and air galley. For gameplay, are we talking mechanics? If so, then yes, AoW SM has much better gameplay mechanics than AoW 1. But in terms of actual gameplay quality, I find the original to be far superiour. SM is far too focused on small amounts of large cities producing small amounts of strong units. Every game is just a rush to level 3 and 4, after a while it gets a bit repetitive. AoW 1, on the other hand, has a very good mix between level 1, 2, 3 and 4 units. It also seems to have a larger difference in level 1 units, espescially swordsmen. They all serve the same purpose, of course, but typically each race's swordsman is significantly different from other races in terms of stats and abilities (the exception being Elf and Dark Elf). There's also a lot more variety between special level 1 units then there is between level 0s in AoW SM. These two factors are very important, as level 1s tend to play an important part in AoW 1.

In the campaign, a corrupt new empire led by the wizard Phobius, has launched an aggressive assault on the ancient races and all things magic. Meanwhile, an even greater evil in the form of hellish demons, breeds within its shadows. The wizard Merlin has been captured by the demons, but can still communicate with his old wizard friends. The player is cast as these wizards as they fight the human empire and the demons.

The main character is the Wizard, who most of the time stays in his wizard tower casting spells in his domain. He researches new spells and abilities and becomes more and more powerful as the game moves on.
 
The simultaneous turn option is not new for Shadow magic, but still a great feature that no other TBS has. This option lets all players play their turn at the same time, and the next turn does not start until they all end their turn.
 
One thing I've always liked with the AoW games is that they focus on strategy and tactics instead of hero developing. This actually makes the game more of a wargame than others in the genre (HoMM etc). The new tactical combat system (new since AoW2) is also very good. It allows lower level units to swarm good units and drain their movement points, and also allows ranged attack units to fire 3, 2 or 1 shots depending on how much they have moved that turn. During sieges, the defender is now allowed to move unlimited number of hexes within the city walls. The fun thing with tactical combat is that an army with a low number of units actually can defeat an army with better/more units if a good tactic is used. The combats are not predetermined in any way like they are in many other games (HoMM, Disciples etc).
 
The Shadow magic editor is great. You can import your own pictures for heroes and wizards, you can create all sorts of events and triggers and last but not least, you can create beautiful worlds of your own! The interface is simple and with just a little talent you can make very pretty maps. The events system allows for many different type of maps to be created, they can be focused on battle, quests, role playing etc. Your imagination is the limit really... The editor is a big part of why I like this game so much.

Mod support. You can access tools in the editor that lets you change most aspects of the game (unit stats, spells, city buildings etc.. There's also an ILB-editor included for those who wants to make new unit graphics.
