He told the Manchester Evening News: "We knew that if we press some keepers that weren't comfortable with back-passes they would kick it long or kick it out but with that man, he was a real key part of the pre-match prep.
 
"You would focus a lot on him because he is the one that dictates and start the pace, he is the one that can start attacks and lead to goals. It's not an accident, it is a talent and it is something that he and Man City have worked on.

"With Ederson you don't know what he's going to do. If you go man for man, at least you try to take away the idea of having a man for him to find with a pass, but then you're in trouble if you are chasing the game and have to press him because he can play around you.
 
"The guy can hit a 90-yard ball onto a stamp. On the ball he's incredible so in a weird kind of way, the worst thing that we decided to do was to press the keeper because he is such a good footballer that's what City's idea is - they want teams to press the goalkeeper. As one player presses the goalkeeper that obviously makes one player spare so ultimately Ederson is able to find that spare player he is that good.
 
"We felt if we didn't press the keeper and let him have it and went more or less man-for-man then it is literally an outfield man to man game but when you've got world-class players that can receive it and players that aren't used to playing at that quality in the Premier League and they sit back, you become a little bit fearful.
 
"You want to force him into long kicks because if you look at his stats there might be two or three kicks in a game that he kicks out or kicks short but it is like when Paul Scholes plays for United - everyone remembers those passes that set up a goal, just like the long ball that Ederson set up the goal against us the season we got relegated. That's football.
 
"His passing, his calmness, his relationship with his back three or two or five, you can see he's got a wonderful relationship and he just knows where to play and the manager works on different match plans for every game - that's why he is the world's best."
 
Garcia spent the night in hospital for tests before being given the all clear. The 19-year-old was back at the City Football Academy on Thursday. Ederson apologised for his part in accident when the pair met.

Liverpool star Sadio Mane's collision with Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson was an accident and did not merit a red card in their Premier League clash on Saturday, the Senegal forward's manager Jurgen Klopp said.
 
Ederson required several minutes attention before being stretchered off in a neck brace but appeared in the stand towards the end of the encounter when City had ruthlessly exploited their one man advantage to win 5-0.
 
Klopp, whose side went into the game unbeaten in their three previous games and having beaten Arsenal 4-0 last time out, said he had bitten his tongue so as not to also be sent to the stands.

"The referee was close to sending me to the stands so I had no power," said the 50-year-old German.

"I said to the fourth official that I did not think it was a red card.

"The foot was not that high, the goalkeeper came out to head the ball.

"Sadio feels bad about it. It is hard for him."

Klopp's City counterpart Pep Guardiola agreed the complexion and balance of the game had been transformed by the red card.

"The game was open until the sending-off," he told Sky Sports.

"Mane did not see him, he was looking at the ball but the impact was huge. I do not know if it was a red card."

Guardiola, whose side went top by a point over city rivals Manchester United who play Stoke later, said thankfully Ederson emerged relatively unscathed. 

"The doctor says there is nothing broken," said Guardiola.

And the fact is, I have been here before. Back in 2013, I flew with a few other journalists on the USMNT charter ferrying the team between World Cup qualifiers in Kingston, Jamaica, and Seattle. When commercial flights between two game locations are a hassle, the added convenience is nice, and we journos pay our own way to prevent any conflict of interest. Media and soccer teams flying together on charters has actually been somewhat common in Europe for travel to Champions League games.
 
The mere fact that there is a charter plane is a sign that U.S. Soccer has come a long way financially over the years. Back when the federation was basically broke, in 2000, I remember flying back with the USMNT on a commercial flight from a World Cup qualifier in Barbados and sitting in economy next to U.S. goalkeeper Zach Thornton. Poor Zach was stuck in a middle seat, and he was a big guy, so he was pushing up against his armrests in a major way.
 
One of the main reasons Zimmerman clawed his way into a lock starting position during World Cup qualifying was his improvement in passing the ball out of the back, a steadiness that eventually won over U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter and helped vault Zimmerman ahead of ball-playing centerbacks Tim Ream and John Brooks. But Zimmerman took a step backward with his passing against Japan.
 
**ON BOARD THE USMNT CHARTER FLIGHT TO ALICANTE, Spain \u2014 Act like you\u2019ve been here before.** That\u2019s my usual mantra when finding myself in unaccustomed situations like sharing a charter flight with the U.S. men\u2019s national team and going through the VIP wing of the airport in D\u00FCsseldorf, Germany, the one that actual rock stars pass through when they travel to their next concert.
 
Middle seats in economy class were a way of life for U.S. national teams for a long time (more so in the not\u2013too-distant past for the women\u2019s team). Say what you will about J\u00FCrgen Klinsmann\u2019s tenure as the USMNT coach, but he did more than anyone else to pressure U.S. Soccer into spending more on travel accommodations (flights, hotels, etc.), which was possible once the federation started bringing in more revenue. As a result, you couldn\u2019t excuse a bad performance by saying you had been staying in a roach motel in Central America or, for that matter, Florida.
 
We\u2019ll get to the no-excuses bad performance the U.S. delivered in Friday\u2019s 2-0 loss to Japan soon enough here, I promise, but having brought you onto Friday\u2019s charter plane, I feel like I should share some details to answer any questions you might have:
 
\u2022 No, the media doesn\u2019t interact with the players onboard. Media and U.S. Soccer staff board first and sit in the back half of the plane. The players and coaches board after that and sit in the front half. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to walk up to Christian Pulisic and ask him for an interview. Everyone\u2019s a pro here. (Again: Act like you\u2019ve been here before.)
 
The vibe is a little like the old Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue launch parties that SI writers would be invited to; the models tolerated our presence (kind of like the USMNT players do now), but it\u2019s not like they were overjoyed we were there. (The one exception was Chrissy Teigen. She always liked meeting writers for some reason. Maybe it was because we weren\u2019t the leering mid-level sponsor bros who were also at those events and took pictures with the models, but you\u2019d have to ask her. I have yet to meet Chrissy\u2019s USMNT equivalent. Remind me to tell you the story of when Cristiano Ronaldo came to that SI swimsuit party when his then-girlfriend, Irina Shayk, was on the cover.)
 
\u2022 Times have changed since the 1970s. When I recently re-watched the classic documentary Once in a Lifetime about the New York Cosmos with Pel\u00E9, Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia, someone in the movie was talking about the charter flight the Cosmos took to the 1977 Soccer Bowl in Portland, Ore., and casually dropped the nugget that at least two sex acts took place on the plane. That is, um, not the case on this flight.
