Document analysis is the first step in working with primary sources. Our worksheets can help teach your students to think through primary source documents for contextual understanding and to extract information to make informed judgments.
 
The first few times you ask students to work with primary sources, and whenever you have not worked with primary sources recently, model careful document analysis using the worksheets. Point out that the steps are the same each time.
 
Eventually, students will internalize the procedure and be able to go through these four steps on their own every time they encounter a primary source document. Remind students to practice this same careful analysis with every primary source they see.
 
For practicing some math skills, there is nothing more effective than a pencil and paper. Our free math worksheets for grades 1-6 cover math skills from counting and basic numeracy through advanced topics such as fractions and decimals.

On this primary teacher worksheet website, you have access to 1 or 2 printables in each skill category. You can download and print those worksheets as often as you want but will have to upgrade to access all of the others. There is also a spot where you can generate your own worksheets with math fact fluency, word searches, fill in the blanks, and multiple-choice questions.
 
This site has primary teacher worksheets that cover a variety of topics and grade ranges. Choose a skill and find the worksheet. There are usually 5-10 worksheets per skill topic to choose from. And each printable usually has 5-10 practice items per page.
 
You can find a variety of skills-based worksheets on this website. Sort by skill or by grade level to find the worksheet you are looking for. You will need Adobe Reader on your computer, as all of these worksheets are downloaded in PDF format.

Many teachers list samples of the full resources they have in their Teachers Pay Teachers shops. You can find worksheets, task cards, clipart, bulletin board pieces, and more in their free library. I highly recommend using the search tools on the left of the screen to narrow your search, as there are many items. You could be scrolling for a very long time.
 
This site highlights a set of themed primary teacher worksheets that change throughout the year. You have access to printables, videos, and other supplemental resources within that particular theme.

All of these resources are similar to those you would find in the Mailbox magazine.
 
Similar to Easy Teacher Worksheets, this site offers primary teacher printables in a variety of subjects. The spotlight for this site is the variety of worksheet generators they have for teachers.

Use the worksheets on this site, or have access to their Test Maker software and create your own assessments. Like Education to the Core Premium, there is a trial member option, giving you limited use of their test making printables. If you purchase a membership, it opens up a lot more worksheets, as well as lesson planning generators and the ability to embed videos in digital lessons.
 
As a free option, you can download and print worksheets on certain skills through this site. You have access to 3 worksheets per listed skill. In order to print more, you have to upgrade your subscription. Increasing your subscription gives you access to more worksheets per skill, as well as other additional features.

The software is asking me to select whether the address is my primary residence is the address I have listed. The software won't let me select "Yes" or "No", yet it's showing that I have an error. I called a rep and they couldn't figure it out.
 
There is clearly a bug in the software here. I noticed other bugs while filling out my taxes so not surprised about this, except I can't fix it. I have used TurboTax for 15+years and have filed returns for many individuals in the past, so I am not a newbie with taxes. I am simply trying to check a box that the software won't allow. I called Support after attempting to troubleshoot my self, and they were also not able to fix this, so the solutions provided aren't working.
 
I am able to provide an address under "My Info". The address is correct. What I can't do is select this as my primary residence. I have seen this same issue posted by many others TT users. I can't select "YES" under the EasyStep process nor can I select this when I go to the Form (Info Worksheet). This is extremely frustrating as I can't file my return until this is fixed.
 
There is a known problem with Home Mortgage Deduction. TurboTax is working to fix the problem and the many other issues. There are many changes due to the CARES Act that require software upgrades. We have not been given an expected date for the fix yet. Please check back often to see if you can file your return.
 
When the IRS has completed the updates to the worksheets based on the CARES Act, TurboTax will be able to program the software to accurately reflect your Home Mortgage deduction you your Federal and State returns.
 
I am unsure as to how this would resolve the issue as I am not claiming any kind of deduction for a home mortgage. It looks to be a technical issue with the checkbox for whether or not the address listed on the California Information Worksheet is my physical address. It doesn't seem to have any connection to the issue that you mentioned. How are these related?
 
You can select specific worksheets to apply the filter to or apply it globally to all worksheets that use the same data source or related data sources. Forexample, you might have a filter that only includes a specific regionor product of interest. Rather than adding this filter every timeyou create a new worksheet, you can simply create the filter once andthen apply it to multiple worksheets.
 
Filters that apply to all related data sources are marked with an icon. The filter is automatically created on any existing worksheets, and on any new worksheets you create that use a related data source.
 
In the Apply Filter to Worksheets dialog box, select the worksheets that you want to apply the filter. If any of the sheets already contain a filter on the same field, the dialog box will provide details about the filter.
 
This option only applies to the current worksheet. This option is selected by default when you create new filters. Filters that are local to the current worksheet are shown without any additional icons.
 
If you apply a filter to all worksheets or selected worksheets and then change the setting to apply the filter to just the current worksheet, the filters are not removed from all other worksheets. Rather, the filters are disconnected and they are all made local to their respective worksheets. You can go to each worksheet and remove the filter or modify selections.
