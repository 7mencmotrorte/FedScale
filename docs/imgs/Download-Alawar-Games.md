These browser hijacking applications are often delivered with small applications called 'helper objects' that prevent users from reverting these changes. Since start.alawar.com is distributed using the 'bundling' method, users often inadvertently install this application.
 
Popular freeware download websites such as soft32.com, softonic.com, and downloads.com often use the bundling method by employing small download programs (also called 'download managers'), which are developed to offer installation of third party apps together with the chosen software.
 
In some cases, these additional apps are hidden under the 'Custom' or 'Advanced' options - many users skip steps of the installation process, and this is an effective way for developers to stealthily install third party software.

After infiltration, these potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) deliver intrusive online adverts, cause browser redirects, diminish browser/computer performance, reduce Internet connection speeds, and gather various user details via information tracking. Displayed ads may redirect to bogus sites, thereby causing high-risk computer infections.
 
The collected data may be personally identifiable and shared with third parties - this can result in serious privacy issues or even identity theft. Although start.alawar.com is not technically a virus or malware, it is categorized as a PUP, and therefore, you should uninstall this browser hijacker immediately.
 
Browser hijacking applications often have different names despite similar or identical behavior. For instance, as with start.alawar.com, start.iminent.com, default-search.net, and mystartsearch.com are also presented as legitimate websites.

Also, applications downloaded from the Internet should be installed using the 'Advanced' or 'Custom' installation options, rather than 'Quick' or 'Typical' - this will reveal any additional software listed for installation and allow you to opt-out.
