After a restart I can choose whether to boot Ubuntu or Windows. When I choose Windows I see screen with purple background with white dots on it for less than a minute and Windows starts normally, but it appears every time I boot Windows.

This is a picture of my laptop screen. The picture in the window is the original image. The picture in the background is the **same** image set as my desktop wallpaper (I understand this isn't something anyone should normally do, but it's just an example.)
 
Any ideas? I've looked all over the internet, and similar reports suggest there's something wrong with the white balance, but since I tried different programs and different RAW files, I can't see how that's the problem.
 
The RAW files coming out of different camera models generally have different encodings. The purple tint means that that particular software does not have the necessary decoders for D5300's NEF files. Same happened to me when I was examining D750 sample NEFs.
 
When I have wallpaper tinting enabled it causes all windows to get a purple hue. This only happens on virtual desktops that are not the one I start up on. So when I turn on my mac I won't have this issue on the virtual desktop I open on, but if I switch to a different one, or make a new one the tint appears. I have no idea what causes this, it has happened since I got the mac in December, and hasn't gone away with the following updates (on 11.2.1 now).

When enabled, it's expected for some windows, menu areas or toolbars to have a subtle tint that matches the color of your desktop wallpaper. If you don't want this to occur, you can disable the feature.
 
Thanks for responding. I understand what wallpaper tinting does, and it works fine on the "first virtual desktop" I open, like I described in my post. The issue is that it applies a weird pink tint on any other virtual desktop I open, so it is not displaying properly. This happens no matter what the background is color is. Does that make sense?
 
Is there a toggle to turn off the purple theme in private windows? As an elderly person I find it hard to see things and it's quite irritating to say the least. This only started showing up in my Windows 10 and my linux systems in FF Version 106 and is also violating my preferences to have a totally blank page when a new private window is opened. Suggestions would be most appreciated.
 
Thanks for the information. It solved the Task bar/URL/Bookmarks etc area but however that didn't have any effect on starting a new private tab with a blank page. However that said, I can live with that! Much appreciated. :-)
 
To reverse the change of private windows opening as a separate window on the windows taskbar: in **about:config** set **browser.privateWindowSeparation.enabled** to false and if you dislike it saying private browsing in the corner, set **browser.privatebrowsing.enable-new-indicator** to false, and the new logo can also be disabled with **browser.privatebrowsing.enable-new-logo** as false.
 
Sometimes it's the big changes in a new OS that really grind your gears. Other times, it's something as simple as finding the background color to be an eyesore. Let's take a look at how you can easily change the background/accent color in Windows 8.
 
It's ridiculous, but I can't tell you how much the default purple color in Windows 8 really bothers me. It's so loud it hurts my face. I want something simple and mute in intensity, like a nice mild gray.
 
Now, before you assume I didn't even attempt to remedy the problem on my own, I did! I've looked in every freaking menu I can find and it's like the setting doesn't even exist. I even searched with Google and found multiple articles, including one you guys wrote about changing the Windows 8 start screen and it's like the setting that was there is now gone. I can't find a single stupid box, check mark, radio button, or anything to even begin the process. What gives? Where did the freaking setting go?
 
First, we commend you on doing some old fashioned search engine leg work to get to the bottom of your problem. Second, rest easy knowing that even though you're failing to find the setting you're looking for, it's not because it's right in front of your face. The crux of your problem is that between Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, Microsoft moved the location of the menu you're looking for (and to an obscure location at that).
 
In Windows 8, you navigate to the menu you're looking for via the Charms bar (WIN+C) then Change PC Settings -> Personalize -> Start Screen, and select the background accent combination you want from the slider interface at the bottom of the Start Screen customization panel. That's the technique outlined in our article you referenced and most likely outlined in all the search results you were finding.
 
Annoyingly, that menu got shifted around and practically buried during the Windows 8.1 update (we'd suspect that shift was/is part of Microsoft's movement to distance Windows 8 from their very poorly received Modern UI). Now to change things you have to find the menu via the search function. You can jump to the search function by pressing WIN+C to pull up the Charms menu and then clicking on the search icon or, for even speedier access, you can simply press WIN+W to jump right to the search box:
 
In the search box, type "accent" to pull up the "Change the background and colors on Start" menu. Even if you use Windows 8.1 entirely in desktop mode, you still need to use this menu to change the color of the popup notifications (like the kind you get when inserting removable media) and the color of the lock screen. In this well-hidden sub-section of the Personalize menu, you can now independently mix and match the background color and accent color:
 
For reference, the background color will be the background color of your Modern interface, as well as the background color of primary Windows 8 Modern-related interfaces such as the background of any sub-menus in the Charms interface. The accent color will be the new color of the Windows 8 Start button, interface buttons, and highlighted options within interface menus. Change both to the shade of gray you're looking for and your problem is solved.
 
I use skype quite abit to talk to the family. Ever since I bought this new laptop, Family has told me that I have a purple tint to me and the background surroundings. I checked for all updates to be up to date. I use the camera app on the laptop and sure enough I have a purple/pinkish to me and surroundings. I do not see the colour black well in any of the pictures. Any one else have this problem. In the device manager under cameras. I see two things. one. HP IR CAMERA AND NEXT HP WIDE VISION FHD CAMERA. My previous laptop did not have this ir camera with no problems. could this be the problem. I checked both to see if the drivers were up to date. they were. Is it possible to choose what camera I could use?

I checked out both webcams in the device manager. I found both to have the driver software up to date. I checked the bios and found it has the current version. So far all has checked out. It took a little practice to get the menu to appear but after several attempts I got to the main menu. Clicked component tests and then to the webcam.
 
First word " More than one webcam installed" Both listed the same " HP wide vision FHD 2090101001" AND THE next line is the same wording different number 20090101002 ..... Excpect early the device manager listed only one as wide vision fhd and the other the IR WEBCAM. Both passed the component tests. Ran both tests twice. Still have the same problem what's next.
