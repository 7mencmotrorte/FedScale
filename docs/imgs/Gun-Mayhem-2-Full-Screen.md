Debates concerning the impacts of screen time are widespread. Existing research presents mixed findings, and lacks longitudinal evidence for any causal or long-term effects. We present a critical account of the current shortcomings of the screen time literature. These include poor conceptualisation, the use of non-standardised measures that are predominantly self-report, and issues with measuring screen time over time and context. Based on these issues, we make a series of recommendations as a basis for furthering academic and public debate. These include drawing on a user-focused approach in order to seek the various affordances gained from "screen use". Within this, we can better understand the way in which these vary across time and context, and make distinction between objective measures of "screen time" compared to those more subjective experiences of uses or affordances, and the differential impacts these may bring.
 
This same thing is happening to me on my TCL Roku TV. Paramount Plus app Displays TMNT Mutant Mayhem with a distorted aspect ratio or possible cuts off 3/4 of the video. This only happens in this one title, on Paramount Plus on Roku TV. Works fine on Google TV in other room

We understand you're having a problem with the Roku TV. We're happy to assist, but we will need more details. Can you please provide the information that @RokuERey provided above? In the meantime, you can also try these steps by unplugging the Roku TV for 3 to 5 minutes and replugging it again, then trying to see if that fixes the issue that you're seeing.
 
Hi - I'm having the same issue with the new TMNT movie on Paramount+ on my Roku TV. The picture is truncated at the top and bottom of the frame with only about 1/3 of the film displaying in the center (vertically) of the screen.
 
I've tried updating the Paramount+ channel and the entire Roku TV (no updates available for either) did a system restart, and also based on this thread, tried unplugging the TV for over 5 minutes. Nothing has fixed the problem.
 
To add to the confusion, if I use the Paramount+ app on my iPhone, the movie refuses to play with the following message: "Fatal Error - Sorry, but due to licensing restrictions, this video isn't available in your location (5411)." I live in Indiana.
 
Finally, I also tried watching the movie directly from the Paramount Plus web site thru the MS Edge browser on my Windows 11 PC. The movie displayed correctly here, both inside the browser window and in fullscreen mode.
 
I forgot to mention in the previous reply that the TMNT movie is the only content that is displaying incorrectly. Everything else I've tried on all the previously mentioned platforms (TV, phone, PC) works just fine.
 
We understand you're having a problem with the Paramount+ channel. No worries! Help is here. Suppose the issue persists on the Paramount+ channel only after attempting the troubleshooting steps, and videos from other channels play fine. In that case, we suggest contacting the channel provider's customer support team to report the issue and get help. The channel developers themselves maintain channels on Roku. In this case, an issue within that specific channel likely needs to be addressed with an update from them.
 
Just wanted to follow up - I had a text chat with Paramount+ support and they "reset" my account(?), after which I was told to unplug the TV for 30 seconds and try it again. This fixed the problem for me. Just as a reminder, I had already tried unplugging the TV before this with no luck, so contacting P+ support directly might be the answer for others having this issue. Thanks again!
 
Yep, same exact issue - TCL 55" Roku TV with Paramount+ with "TMNT: Mutant Mayhem"-huge crop/letterbox, tried signing in/out/unplug/settings/nothing worked. ONE TIME it actually started correctly - I THINK bc by chance Dolby Vision didn't kick in? Movie paused and reloaded and was OK, but I think DV still wasn't on. (Can't turn DV off on either TV or app so I can't confirm.) Went back to menu, back to this movie, same problem no matter what else. This movie ONLY, everything else (including other DV content on Paramount app) fine.
 
Hi, I've been trying to get Magic & Mayhem to run windowed but I've been having some issues. The opening FMV will play, but once it gets to the title screen everything is completely black. I can still seemingly interact with the title screen and I can hear the game audio, but it's impossible to see anything. It works fine in fullscreen mode without DxWnd.
 
I'm using a CD version of the game, but I've tried alternatives and they all have the same issues. I'm using the default settings for the latest DxWnd version, so I haven't tinkered around with it much.
 
First thing you may try is setting the "DirectX(2) / Clipper" flag to "ON", for some strange reason and for a few games the lack of the clipper causes a black screen without any error notification.  
If that doesn't work, some logs may help me. You can read the "Taking logs" page in the DxWnd help (see Help -> View Help ...).  
In any case, ASAP I'll try the game myself: sometimes the updates of DxWnd or of the operation systems may bring some regression problem in game that were working ok.
 
I should clarify as well that when the opening FMV starts, if I allow it to play for a certain length of time the window suddenly stops responding, but the FMV continues to play. If I press escape to skip it before this happens or if I wait for it to finish I get to the title screen, but as I say I can't actually see anything. Turning the Clipper flag on causes the FMV image to freeze while the audio continues to play.
 
It was late in the evening and I switched off my computer, or so I thought. Abruptly it flashed up the Blue Screen of Death, my first experience of this infamous phenomenon. I took a photo and slept on it (the event, idiomatically; not the photo, literally).
 
My modest adventure from screen of death to web of life has a lesson, if not a moral: next time you hear of someone experiencing a Blue Screen of Death, suggest that they check their computer for invertebrate residents.
 
Thanks Dave, and yes I am lucky to have experienced it only once. Everything essential on my PC was backed up, so there was no panic, but still. Maybe it was a warning for me to mend my ways, and dust inside my computer more often!
 
According to this article from nationalpost.com, too much screen time can result in **reduced attachment** between parent and child and **impedes social interactions.**Children tend to block out the physical environment around them resulting in our kids becoming zombies!
 
Here is another great article from habyts.com that shows other negative effects that occur from too much screen time. They mention 6 which are, sleep deprivation, obesity, vision problems, aches and pains, loss of social skills and aggression.
 
Across 3 different PCs I upgraded to Windows 10 recently I had 3 different issues. The biggest issue on the laptop that was upgraded was having the new Settings screen close immediately after opening. It would flash up for a moment, then close.
 
It would affect other similar screens (that kind of look the same, with that new UI) and was particularly annoying me as I wanted to set up Default Apps, connect to VPN, and do some other things that I could only access via the Settings page. Rebooting made no difference. But finally I found a fix!
 
I pride myself in supporting other makers. I want you to build a tshirt business that will help you support your family like I did. I am here to support you and help you along your journey. Screen print transfers are just the tip of the iceberg!
 
I built a 7 figure Etsy business using screen print transfers. I have learned so much over the last 5 years. I know the ins and outs and our products have been used and tested. The quality is top notch! I know everything there is to know about running a top selling shirt shop. I can't wait to teach you everything I know.
 
As I said before, modern IP films, reboots, and remakes, often fall into traps and never find the right balance in satisfying several generations of fans (nor several generations regardless of them being fans). **Mutant Mayhem** is a master class in entertaining a 42-year old **Turtles** fan of the first generation, my wife (whose age I almost wrote down but then remembered I have appointments I need to be alive for next week) whose stance was neutral, and a 6 year-old whose Turtle watching is very much focused on cartoons from the past couple of years.

The real problem here is your normative notion of what an ant body is \*supposed\* to look like. Sora chose to show us a day in the life of an ant who is differently-abled, which I think is commendable. #RepresentationMatters
