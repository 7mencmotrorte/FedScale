Much like the title of the game itself, the newly released console edition is a "hard reset" of the genre, giving people who miss the days of Quake and Wolfenstein 3D exactly what they've asked for.

While Hard Reset does have a plot, it is (I feel) intentionally straightforward and hokey. The cutscenes are well animated, reminding me of the Twisted Metal 2 endings with their cut-out comic book stylings, but from moment one in the game it offers you to skip them the second the next level is loaded. The story is there for those who want it, regarding robots in the future that need 'sploded, but if you are in a "blow up anything that moves" mood, you won't miss out without the firm grasp of the storyline. The game truly bucks most every trend of modern gaming, which sends you back to the days of finding a plumber on screen that can walk right and jump on turtles. You do it because the game leads you to it. You don't know why, you just do.
 
There was definitely a different strategy to FPS games at their inception. Modern shooters rely on auto-regenerating health, which streamlined the process and helped you get to the action and through the levels faster. Unfortunately, some poorly designed games then boil down to shoot, hide, wait, shoot, hide, wait, wash, rinse, repeat. Classic FPS games left health and ammo packs through the world, and picking them up meant using them: no inventory or cache of goods to snack on through the game. This mechanic keeps you wondering: do I need to pick up that for full health to get through the next room, or can I survive without and get more health for the pickup after this wave? This also translates to tons of hidden rooms to find and other random secrets to give you a sense of accomplishment when found.
 
Much like older titles with limited memory, Hard Reset only has a few enemy types. Challenge and difficulty increase as you progress by making them more difficult to kill, faster, or changing up the combination of enemies. While the full game has some boss fights, the biggest challenges center around seeing a wave of enemies and knowing their strengths and weaknesses, then manipulating and exploiting them to your benefit. There are tons of environment specific attacks, such as activating an electrical item that shocks nearby enemies or the ever popular Big Red Explosive Barrel. You have two weapons that get upgrades and new modes that basically give you an infinite variety of destruction.
 
The game delivers as promised, harkening back to classic game design and gameplay. Instead of trying to pull at your heartstrings with a sappy story or constantly trying to wow you with a new explosion or set-piece, Hard Reset gives you a toolbox of expected ways for the world to behave, and allows you to puzzle out how to get through it all (which regularly translates to "blow the snot out of everything that moves"). Unfortunately, the classic style of FPS does return with some faults. Killing the enemies and then hunting for secrets can be rather mundane, as there's nothing chasing you. Losing your bearings is unforgiving. If you don't know where your goal is, you'll be hunting away until you happen upon it. Perhaps my most frustrating experience was with the old "puzzle your way through a building" section, where I know I'm supposed to get to the top floor. There are stairs, with a waist-high hole in a grate that blocks the whole path, only big enough for enemies to get through. Can I squat and climb through? No. Can my giant gun open the hole a bit more? Nope. Instead, it's "activate machinery, go outside, cross to another building, solve puzzles there, cross back" only to find myself in the same building, next floor up. I was able to go back down the stairs and see the other side of the same grate. I felt that to be a bit of a poor design choice. A one-way door or dangerous materials the enemy can walk through would be one thing, but for the savior of the world to be foiled by a slightly-too-small-to-comfortably-walk-through hole just frustrated me. In the games it is trying to emulate, you would often at least see a secret through that hole, and remembering it with a smattering of backtracking once you get on the other side would lead to a cool new weapon or piece of armor.

Hard Reset is a solo game, no multiplayer to be found. Centering the battle versus the machines means lots of cool explosions and destruction without a lot of blood. Some of the battles can get difficult with the memorization and following of patterns of multiple enemies. There were a few instances I mismanaged my ammunition and had to get creative to dispatch my opponents as well. Hard Reset could be a game a parent may feel more comfortable sharing with a youth just getting into the genre, since good strategy allows a fun, less gore-filled introduction to the world of First-Person Shooters, and would allow a new player to learn the mechanics without dealing with the learning curve of online play.
 
Overall, Hard Reset oozes nostalgia. Hardcore gamers will probably blast through it in no time, but going back in and upgrading your weapons to more destructive levels on a second playthrough will bring them back for more carnage. If you're a huge fan of current FPS games and feel they've done nothing but improve in the last twenty years, you may be disappointed. If you are truly looking for a hard reset of the FPS genre to it's original glory days, Hard Reset is for you.
 
Hello and welcome to the madness!
The challenge is simple: **Play and beat any 6 games, starting today, that have been featured in any given Humble Monthly/Choice bundle in two months.**
 
Game length does not matter and I'm not looking for 100% achievement runs. So long as you play and beat 6 games, I'm happy. You can go easy mode and play a bunch of 1h games or go crazy and play 6 +30h games. So long as they were in a monthly at a given point, it is all good.
 
Just post a comment with either screenshots/ achievements showing that you fulfilled the criteria and I'll add you on Steam and give you the link. Feel free to share your thoughts on the games you've played, but it is not required.
 
I hate money. That and I realized I've been subbed to the monthly for over seven years (yes it has been that long, I checked) and it occurred to me that I've barely touched the games I've gotten from it, let alone played them. Figured the same would be true for a few others, so I figured this is a good way to change that. A sensible person would probably unsub in this situation, but please refer to the beginning as to why that will not happen.
 
No. The reason being that those who own a Steam copy would have an extra option that would not be available to everyone who bought the same bundle. If the game was originally sold as a non-Steam copy, but Humble later provided steam keys to everyone who bought the bundle, then the game would be allowed.
 
This event "ends" on June 6th when the next next HB Choice releases, though the giveaway itself will end the next day. If you manage to finish game number six in between that time, feel free to post, but know that I cannot guarantee that I'll be able to give you the link in time.
 
**Invites will begin next week and be put on pause on May 13/14th. Invites will resume on June 2nd until the end of the event. If you have completed your set, please post as soon as possible so I can catch you within the first round. If not, you will have to wait.**
 
The Life and Suffering of SIr Brante Stand your Ground... several endings
Life is Strange 2 Wolf Pack
Disciples Liberation The Old World Ends (beaten, but fyi: this game got stale after 20 hours or so)
Forgive me Father Truth Hurts
Death Stranding Thanks for Everything
Operation Tango It Takes Two... (Played all co-op missions)
 
Abandoned:
Othercide: felt like a subpar xcom to me
Call of the Sea: walking simulator that didn't interest
Eldest Souls: maybe too hardcore for me, but I thought the attacks weren't well telegraphed
 
No idea what I'm gonna end up playing yet, but I'm pretty excited to give some longer games a try that I wouldn't be able to beat in one month! Would Revita be eligible for the event? As far as I know it doesn't have any "beat x boss" or "beat the game for the first time" achievements but it must have some final-final boss.
 
Really liked all the games this time around! I said I was gonna try to play something longer because of the 2-month event but I just ended up playing a ton of Revita, looking forward to the 2.0 version to release so I can play it some more.
 
\*Paradise Killer didn't really have a true ending achievement so I've included a "thanks for playing" scene screenshot that you get after beating the game post credits, let me know if that's enough or If I need to submit something else. I could always get that "beat the game in 10 mins" achievement but it just boils down to mashing though all text prompts afaik.
 
Revita is fine and I'll be looking for the Tower Dweller achievement. There is a true ending that is tied to the Unknown Dweller achievement which I was considering but I feel like it would be too much of an ask to require it.
 
just a note on Greedfall: it took me 48 hours to finish while getting ALL of the side content complete and reloading my final save multiple times to get the different endings. you absolutely don't have to worry about a 175 hour venture here.
 
48 hours seems manageable! I hope, I will be able to "sync" with the game so that it wouldn't become a chore. Like it was for me with Dragon Dogma (I know, I know, it's an underappreciated treasure, but its DLC shouldn't have to force you to crawl
