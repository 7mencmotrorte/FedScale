The gladiator Spiculus enters the arena one last time in this text-based simulator. Armed with a sword and shield, he fights gladiator after gladiator until he is killed. The character Spiculus is inspired by one of the most famous gladiators of the 1st century AD Rome. Spiculus won many great battles and was well-known by audiences. He was particularly admired by the emperor Nero who rewarded him with palaces and riches for his heroics.

[The GameDiscoverCo game discovery newsletter is written by \u2018how people find your game\u2019 expert & company founder Simon Carless, and is a regular look at how people discover and buy video games in the 2020s.]
 
We have big plans for the year here - and we already have the first three or four newsletters mapped out. So let\u2019s start out by looking behind the scenes on a long in-development solo game whose launch on PC/Steam went\u2026 great!

[**For the New Year:** please support our work via a **GameDiscoverCo Plus paid subscription**. This includes an exclusive Friday PC/console game trend analysis newsletter, a big Steam \u2018Hype\u2019 & performance chart back-end, eBooks, an informative member-only Discord & more.]
 
You may have noticed we do a fair amount of \u2018solo creator makes good!\u2019 success stories here. There\u2019s two reasons for this: firstly, solo devs find it easier to be transparent. But secondly, I think many people underestimate the potency of tiny-creator games.
 
The democratization of tools means that great-looking games you might think were made by 10-20 devs can be made by just one core creator. And nowhere did we have a better example in late 2022 than Jordy Lakiere\u2019s \u201Cbrutal sandbox of sand, death, and [gladiator] mayhem\u201D We Who Are About To Die.
 
**Designing for influencers paid off:** the gladiator \u201Cwho tries to attain glory or dies trying\u201D performs with YouTubers like NorthernLion particularly well, and Jordy admits \u201CI did anticipate this a bit - who doesn't want to watch blood sports? Especially with real stakes? Is their favorite streamer going to lose their character?\u201D
 
**The dev doubled down on \u2018emotional stakes\u2019:** loved what Jordy told me here: \u201CThe game tugs at your emotions. It plays with frustration, skill, random goofiness and physics. People are often shouting or giggling - it\u2019s a great time to watch (even personally!) The camera is also angled down as if you're an audience member watching the game.\u201D
 
The more I talked to Lakiere about this, the more I realized that \u2018designing for discovery readability\u2019 was something he practices. For example: \u201CThe disconnection of the camera from the directional input means it's a lot easier to digest than most skill based melee combat games - they are harder to watch with the camera swinging wildly.\u201D
 
But how did a solo dev get the game to look - and play - so well? We\u2019re more used to \u2018programmer art\u2019-adjacent small team hits like RimWorld in the Steam ecosystem. Here\u2019s what went right for this game:
 
**The game is super-smart about art efficiency:** \u201CArt is my wheelhouse, so I managed to go hard and keep speeding up workflows... There\u2019s a lot of cutting corners, being 'lazy' intelligently, and focusing on what really matters. For example, many of the models are very low quality & many textures are re-used in ways that would upset a real 3D artist. But I spent tons of time on materials, post-process, composition and lighting.\u201D
 
**Asset store purchases were actually kept to a minimum**: there\u2019s nothing wrong with using these intelligently, but: \u201CI barely used any external assets (bought from marketplace) and handmade nearly everything. Part of me just wanted this project to be my 'art' and genuinely mine/hand-made. I only got one set of Roman environmental 3D asset packs, when I just thought they were a perfect fit and quite affordable.\u201D
 
So that\u2019s how we ended up with a top-quality solo developed title. Interestingly, Jordy adds: \u201CLots of people over the years recommended I hide the fact that [the game is] solo-developed. But using this as a hook, and also setting the tone in terms of quality & scope (e.g. to expect bugs etc) really really helped, I think.\u201D
 
**The game\u2019s interest swelled closer to Steam launch:**Jordy says \u201CNext Fest last June went quite well for me\u2026 and it got me up to 21k [Steam wishlists]. It also increased my baseline (mostly from demo coverage and word of mouth), so I grew 'relatively fast' to 35k the week before launch. Then, viral posts in launch week and Popular Upcoming shot me to 57k wishlists at launch.\u201D There were 182k outstanding wishlists in early Dec, btw.
 
**We Who Are About To Die actually has above average refunds:**around 16% refund, though Jordy notes he expected it, since the game \u201Creally kicks your ass and then kicks you while you are down some more, and the learning curve is more of a learning wall.\u201D Most refund messages are \u201Ceither about difficulty/jankiness (how the combat feels when not used to it) or just bugs preventing play (eg. widescreen issues etc).\u201D
 
A bonus interesting point: **you can come back from a slowing organic wishlist rate, as this game did**. After June 2022\u2019s Next Fest, it was averaging 100 wishlists per day with nothing going on. But it dipped all the way to 15 wl/day before picking up again for launch.
 
Anyhow, thanks to Jordy for sharing all of this intensely practical data. What I find fascinating here is that one human can do so much. (It\u2019s somewhat rare, but not vanishingly so - Walt Destler\u2019s Cosmoteer is another recent example.) And remember, everyone making games competes against competent solo devs\u2026
 
We at GameDiscoverCo are experts at PC and console game discovery, yes. Mobile, not so much. Which is why we\u2019re still loving Matej Lancaric\u2019s long, complex but rewarding analyses of paid user acquisition on mobile, capped by his 2022 round-up.
 
These are worth wading into - despite the complexity of the acronyms - for all. PC & console games are not going \u2018full mobile\u2019 from a paid discovery & monetization point of view - but they\u2019re certainly slipping in that direction. Some key takeaways:
 
**A cheap & effective new mobile UA source? That\u2019d be TikTok:**Matej notes**-** \u201CI know it\u2019s pretty annoying not to be able to target every country, but when you have your account manager, you are good to go. [And] the performance is so freaking good. I can see 4x lower CPIs on TikTok when compared to other channels (mainly Facebook) and the quality is even better.\u201D
 
**Profitable UA is only possible if your game monetizes:**as Matej says**-**\u201CPeople still think scaling the game is only a marketing team\u2019s job\u2026. [but] scaling a game is not only a function of a killer user acquisition operation. It is also a function of an LTV [life-time value].\u201D It\u2019s over-simplified, but for example, \u201CIf your LTV is $5, you can run profitable campaigns until you hit $4.5 CPI [cost per install].\u201D
 
Anyhow, there\u2019s lots more in the full piece. And I\u2019m learning a lot about the main discovery engine for mobile (spending lots of money!) along the way. It can be a different and slightly cut-throat, but knowing is half of the battle here.
 
Before everyone retired for the holidays on the Microsoft x Activision deal: Activision\u2019s corp EVP Lulu Cheng Meservey went on the attack on Twitter: \u201CAntitrust law exists to protect consumers, not competitors. The FTC is doing the opposite with their baseless, ideologically-driven suit to stop the Microsoft / Activision Blizzard deal.\u201D And the UK\u2019s CMA said that the 2,000+ public responses to Xbox\u2019s Activision deal were mostly (75%) supportive of the merger.
 
Game trailers are important! Which is why we loved Derek Lieu\u2019s \u2018favorite game trailers of 2022\u2019 rundown, which splits things up intro a bunch of categories like Best Idealized Gameplay, Best Multiplayer Capture, Best Cinematic Single Player Trailers, and lots more\u2026
 
Those with a Steam account noticed, but Steam Replay is Valve\u2019s version of Spotify Wrapped, etc. As DigitalTrends explains: \u201CSteam Replay shows your hours played, your most played games, the achievements you\u2019ve unlocked, and much more.\u201D You can keep it private, share just with friends, or show everyone - good stuff.
 
Wondered what happened to early AR headset pioneer Magic Leap? Well: \u201CDuring the course of its recent funding rounds, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Public Investment Fund (PIF) took a stake of more than 50pc in the business, giving it overall majority control.\u201D And - focused more on B2B users - it\u2019s looking for more funding.
 
The crew at SteamDB have an interesting rating algorithm to work out the \u2018best-reviewed but also popular\u2019 games of the year, and here it is for 2022\u2019s titles. Vampire Survivors, Stray, the PC conversion of God Of War and Powerwash Sim top the chart, but there\u2019s plenty of other interesting titles up near the top!
 
Valve posted its December Steam video Q&A replay on YouTube, in which \u201Cmembers of the Steam Business Team answer developers' questions about registering for and getting the most out of Steam Next Fest.\u201D Some useful tidbits in there, and if you registered in time, the next Nest Fest (!) starts on February 6th.
