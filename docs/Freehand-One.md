I have a problem with the freehand tool with Arcgis Pro 3.2: when I draw a polyline or a polygone, the features were smoothed automatically in beziers curves. 
Since I'm tracing an orthophoto of an archaeological dig, I need the line to remain as faithful as possible to the mouse path, but I don't understand how to turn off the beziers curves. 
I also tried the stream tool but it don't work for me...

In the Help documentation for "create a freehand polyline feature" it states in the last sentence that "the segments are automatically converted to Bezier curves." I don't believe there's a way to modify this item with the freehand tool. You may want to find another polyline construction tool that accomplishes the digitizing workflow you wish to see.
 
In the miniature community we use the term freehand to describe using paint alone to create patterns/pictures/textures on flat surfaces. (In contrast to when those details are sculpted directly into the surface and we are using paint to bring out the sculpted details.) I have a previous article on freehand that discusses considerations for subject and colour choices.
 
A note to those who know that I also do 2D drawing and painting The two figures with freehand dragons and the two scenes that include painted text were all painted prior to when I started to study traditional art as an adult. I had taken art class in high school, but that was many years before I started painting miniatures.

Practice and preparation greatly improve your chances for successfully painting freehand. However, I have at times also found practice to be discouraging, so I think it might be worth sharing some tips for how to practice in ways that will give you the most benefit.
 
In my early days as a painter, when I started to practice to work up to painting freehand, I began with pencil on paper. While there is some value to that, my experience was that it can also lead you astray or be discouraging.
 
Painting freehand on a miniature involves using a brush to apply liquid paint to a non-absorbent surface. This is a completely different set of tools from using dry pencil or pen on paper. Drawing on paper is of no benefit in learning how paint acts, nor in developing muscle memory to use paint on a brush. Note that painting directly on paper is also not the same experience as painting on a miniature, since paint behaves differently on the absorbent paper than on the non-absorbent surface of a primed/painted miniature.
 
Plastic practice surfaces can work well, as plastic is non-absorbent. I often use black miniature bases or the bottoms of Bones miniatures for a little quick freehand practice. Plastic like blister packs and washed sour cream container lids is also a good practice surface, though you may need to add a coat of paint or primer to some plastics for them to take in the same way a painted miniature does.
 
It can be helpful to actually measure/trace the area on your figure and copy that onto your practice surface. The tick marks on the practice sheet for the tiny dragon above are 5mm apart so I could keep the size of the area on her shawl in mind. The black stripes in the following image are the size of the street sign I wanted to paint.
 
In reality I did not do a ton of advance practice prior to painting the shield images, but keep a few things in mind before you judge me for not practicing what I preach. At the time I painted this I had painted all of the above figures and several more with freehand and precision detail painting. I had also been studying traditional art for a few years, so was practicing in other ways. And most importantly, I was on a tight deadline and willing to roll the dice a little. ;->
 
In the photograph below you can see my practice surface and the shield prior to any freehand. My practice surface was the bottom of a Bones miniature. I practiced making the basic shapes, and worked out the steps I would use to apply those shapes to the miniature. The black border section was drawn with Sharpie, based on measurements of the smaller area on the shield, to ensure I did a practice run at the same size area as I would be working on the figure.
 
The silhouette tree design was inspired by some clipart tree drawings. Silhouette style art can be tricky in that it does not have shading and highlighting applied, or any other colours. Part of why I practiced was to feel confident that the basic shape of the tree I had designed was clear and interesting enough to work well as a silhouette.
 
I started to build up the flat black colour on the trees. I did this in multiple slightly thinned coats. Again, better to go slowly and carefully than have to spend a lot of time and effort fixing mistakes.
 
The effect in the WIP picture below is a little like shading and highlighting with some depth and variation in the trees, so this also gives you an idea of how something painted with a little variation of colour/shading can look different than a flat shape or simple line art.

How do you draw freehand in LibreOffice Draw? Is there a "pencil tool"? I can see on the left that there's a button to change the "Line Color" and it looks like a pencil, but clicking this doesn't seem to let me draw anything.
 
Click on that tool icon. When the cursor is over the workspace, it will change to a crosshair. Position it where you want to start, then click and drag where you want the line. Release the button when you're done.
 
BTW, if you mess up, you can reselect the line (if it isn't still defined by an object box), and delete it. So you can practice and explore the features and options and then delete it without affecting anything.
 
How about making vector layer usable for drawing using brush presets? Drawing freehand on a vector layer is much more easier when it comes to inking. Vector layer enables us to adjust the drawing without ruining the quality. This is also useful when animating. It will shorten the burden when it comes to animate hair blowed by wind. I came up with this idea when I was making an animation in Krita.
 
There is a freehand path tool right next to bezier curve tool. I doubt that you can make brush presets work for vector curves because of the fundamental difference of how vector and raster images work and the limitations of vector graphics in general.
 
**I have finally found out how to enable it. It could be seen in the QField Settings. The "Consider mouse as a touchscreen device" should be disabled for the Freehand Digitizing function to work.**
 
I have a problem, with freehand digitizing in Qfield. It works with connected mouse. When using stylus, I can activate the freehand editing button, but editing is only possible in traditional way by adding nodes.The stylus I use is battery loaded, but without bluetooth or anything.
 
The main thing to note here is picking the midpoint. It might seem reasonable to start painting at the start of the text, but actually, you want to start in the middle and work outwards. This ensures the text is placed where you want it on the miniature. Count how many letters and spaces there are in the text, and paint the middle letter first. In the case of my example below, the middle character was actually a space so I marked it with a small line.

Objectives:  A randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare all three known static guided surgery protocols (pilot, partial, and full) with each other and with freehand surgery in terms of accuracy, under the same conditions.
 
Material and methods:  A total of 207 implants of the same brand and type were placed in 101 partially edentulous volunteers in need of implantation in the mandible or maxilla or both. All cases were digitally planned, and the comparison of the planned and actual implant positions was performed using a medical image analysis software with dedicated algorithms. The primary outcome variable was angular deviation (AD, degrees). The secondary outcome variables were coronal global deviation (CGD, mm), apical global deviation (AGD, mm), and voxel overlap (VO, %).
 
Results:  AD showed stepwise improvement in significant steps as the amount of guidance increased. The highest
