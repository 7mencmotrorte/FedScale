Given that node is not the "best" at handling such DDoS Conditions within the framework itself I would look into third part DDoS Mitigation tactics such as cloudflare or blacklotus. They are costly offerings if you have a huge scale of use but they will protect Node or really any framework from denial of service attacks.
 
I have a app which lets yoy keep your notes at a single place its realtime bw all the devices you are logged in I am using a nodejs wesocket it was working fine but a recently i found out someone was sending a huge amount of requests to my websocket server. He sent a large amount of data through websockets to my mongodb and the data was sent just for the purpose of taking the app down (useless crap data just had 'aaaaa')

As mentioned in the comments its better to go with services like CloudFlare, but for your specific use case (to implement directly on server) you should look at ways to **rate limit** the requests.
Here is an example of an library to rate limit web-sockets in node -rate-limit
 
I have a home network, big family, with around 20 devices on it at any given time. It seems like every year or so, some device gets a virus or a security flaw is revealed, and the device starts behaving badly.
 
But the latest thing we have experienced this year is that the affected device will start firing off 1000's of requests to some site. Afterwards, I get on a DDOS ban list. For example, I can at this time not access
 
An answer below has helped me understand that this is due to Akamai Tecnhologies blocking my IP. I called Akamai Tecnhologies and they confirmed this and let me know that my IP was suspected as "Web Scraping." Meaning some sort of malware must have made tons of web requests to site(s) protected by Akamai Tecnhologies and therefore got flagged as a DDoS attacker. Not necessarily malware, it could have been some rogue software issue that caused these excessive requests too. I have contacted them trying to get the exact sites it hit so that I can debug further.
 
Namely, I need a way to get an alert when my home network has suddenly become a DDOS attack node. Ideally something could be attached to the router to send me a notification - "hey device IP 192.168.1.x just started making 1000's of requests to sites so I have blocked its access until you take action."
 
As explained in the pi-hole documentation (and video documentation) you configure your router to use the pi-hole machine as a DNS server. See this video circa 0:57 seconds: youtube.com/watch?v=vKWjx1AQYgs

The simplest of the suggestions though would be to write an e-mail to a DDoS mitigation service provider which is denying you access and to kindly ask for support and clarification. A DDoS mitigation provider probably knows what kind of malware you should expect to see in your network out of its network fingerprint that is left.
 
Looks like the provider in question is Akamai Tecnhologies in your case, because three of four domain names you've provided point to Akamai IP addresses. USPS probably either has some dedicated equipment bought and deployed or is serviced by AT&T, in either case, Akamai would be easier to reach.
 
Other methods are a lot more complicated. However, one thing you've apparently forgotten to do is to check your externally facing gateway router (or just to reflash it and update it to a latest firmware version). SOHO routers are a common target for malware.
 
Also, it might not as well be your fault. Some DDoS mitigation services implement a technique that could best be described as "network redlining", i.e. preventing access from whole networks which seem suspicious, blocking entire ISPs or countries (e.g. China, if we speak of a U.S.-based network service), and so on. To make sure you aren't affected by this, ask your friends and neighbours, try to figure out if other customers of your ISP experience the same set of issues.
 
it can make node almost unresponcible when garbige collector at work on small power nodes.
Desctop pc will win on this. On other side, today garbige collector delete after 7 days, after it will delete file as satellite will tel it to delete and will not be so many ant one time as now.

A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a deliberate attempt by ahostile actor to disrupt operations of publicly exposed sites, systems, andAPIs, with the goal of degrading the experience of legitimate users.For workloads usingexternal passthrough Network Load Balancers,protocol forwarding, or VMs withpublic IP addresses, Google Cloud Armor offers the following options to help protectsystems against DDoS attacks:
 
You configure advanced network DDoS protection on a per-region basis. Instead ofassociating the network edge security policy with one or more target pools,target instances, backend services, or instances with external IP addresses,you associate it with a network edge security service in a particular region.When you enable it for that region, Google Cloud Armor provides always-ontargeted volumetric attack detection and mitigation for external passthrough Network Load Balancer, protocolforwarding, and VMs with public IP addresses in that region. You can only applyadvanced network DDoS protection to projects that are enrolled inCloud Armor Enterprise.
 
When you configure advanced network DDoS protection, you first create a securitypolicy of the type CLOUD\_ARMOR\_NETWORK in a region that you choose. Next, youupdate the security policy to enable advanced network DDoS protection. Finally,you create a network edge security service, a resource to which you can attachsecurity policies of type CLOUD\_ARMOR\_NETWORK. Attaching the security policyto the network edge security service enables advanced network DDoS protection for allapplicable endpoints in the region that you chose.
 
Advanced network DDoS protection measures your baseline traffic to improve its mitigationperformance. When you enable advanced network DDoS protection, there is a training period of24 hours before advanced network DDoS protection develops a reliable baseline and can useits training to enhance its mitigations. When the training period is over,advanced network DDoS protection applies additional mitigation techniques based on historicaltraffic.
 
Your project must be enrolled in Cloud Armor Enterprise to enableadvanced network DDoS protection on a per-region basis. After they are activated, all regionalendpoints in the activated region receive always-on advanced network DDoS protection.
 
Ensure that there is an active Cloud Armor Enterprise subscription in yourbilling account, and that the current project is enrolled inCloud Armor Enterprise. For more information about enrolling inCloud Armor Enterprise, seeSubscribing to Cloud Armor Enterprise and enrolling projects.
 
Before you can delete a network edge security policy, you must first remove itfrom the network edge security service because you cannot delete in-usesecurity policies. Use the following steps to delete your security policy:
 
Cloud Armor Enterprise subscribers can also enable preview mode foradvanced network DDoS protection policies. In preview mode, you receive all of the logging andtelemetry about the detected attack and the proposed mitigation. However, theproposed mitigation is not enforced. This lets you test theeffectiveness of the mitigation before enabling it. Because each policy isconfigured per region, you can enable or disable preview mode per region.
 
If your security policy is in preview mode during an active attack and you wantto enforce the mitigations, you can update your security policy to set the--network-ddos-protection flag to ADVANCED. The policy is enforcedalmost immediately, and the next MITIGATION\_ONGOING logging event reflects thechange. MITIGATION\_ONGOING logging events occur every five minutes.
 
Google Cloud Armor generates three types of event logs when mitigating DDoSattacks: MITIGATION\_STARTED, MITIGATION\_ONGOING, and MITIGATION\_ENDED. Youcan use the following log filters to view your logs by mitigation type:

Traditional Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are designed to exploit bottlenecks within a system. This is accomplished by sending it more traffic than its network card can handle, overwhelming an application with more requests than it can manage, etc.
 
Within a blockchain network, no fixed single point of failure exists. No node in a blockchain network is indispensable, meaning that any node can go down due to a DDoS attack or other incident without taking down the network as a whole.
 
However, this does not mean that blockchain networks are immune to DDoS attacks. By flooding the blockchain with spam transactions, an attacker can reduce its availability for legitimate users and potentially have other impacts on the network.
 
The decentralization of blockchain networks has made some say that DDoS attacks against a blockchain are impossible. However, this is **not** strictly true. Traditional DDoS attacks can be executed against a blockchain to slow its operations, and attackers can work within the blockchain ecosystem to perform a DDoS attack.
 
Many traditional DDoS attacks are performed at the application level rather than at the network level. An organization may have invested in large network links that make it inf
