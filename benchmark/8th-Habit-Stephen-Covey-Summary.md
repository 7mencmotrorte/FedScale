Dr Stephen Covey (1932-2012) was and remains a hugely influential management guru. Covey's most famous book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, became a blueprint for personal development when it was published in 1990.
 
Covey's values are full of integrity and humanity and contrast strongly with the authority-driven process-based ideologies that characterise management and leadership thinking in earlier times. Indeed Covey's methods extend and adapt with increasing relevance to many more areas in the modern world, for example, parenting, relationships, mediation, counselling, etc.

Covey produced a substantial body of educational and teaching work. The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People was his first significantly popular creation and probably remains his greatest. Below is a quick summary of his main ideas.
 
Stephen Covey's Seven Habits are a simple set of rules for life - inter-related and synergistic, and yet each one powerful and worthy of adopting and following in its own right. For many people, reading Covey's work, or listening to him speak literally changes their lives. Covey's thinking is powerful stuff indeed and highly recommended.
 
In his more recent book 'The 8th Habit', Stephen Covey introduced (logically) the **eighth habit, which deals with personal fulfilment and helping others to achieve fulfilment too**, which aligns helpfully with Maslow's notions of 'Self-Actualization' and 'Transcendence' in the Hierarchy of Needs modeland also with the later life-stages in Erikson's Psychosocial Life-Stage Theory.

The circle of influence consists of all the things that you can control (your attitude, what you read, what skills you learn, your enthusiasm, how you spend your free time and who you spend it with, your habits and hobbies, and so on).
 
Lets look at an example of how a proactive and reactive person respond to the same situation. 2 people take a test and they both fail. One blames the teacher and gives up and the other takes responsibility and studies harder and tries to improve themselves. The reactive person complains about how bad the teacher is and the proactive person asks, what can I do? They look at themselves first instead of blaming and complaining.

And keep in mind, as you become more proactive within your circle of influence, it grows bigger and you bring more power into your life. Even if you only implement 1 habit out of the 7 habits, make it this one. This one alone can have a huge impact on your life. You either act or are acted upon.
 
We could all use a little help in the time management department. We all have a lot to do, so, how do we manage our time effectively? Usually we all write things down on an endless to do list. We tend to go in order from top to bottom with no real priorities. Or you schedule things on a calendar, which is a decent practice, but with one interruption and our whole game can be thrown off. You could also try daily planning based on priorities, but again, one interruption can mess it all up (most of us fall into this time management scheme). There is another way though.
 
Joe wakes up early, exercises for 30 minutes, eats a healthy breakfast, leaves early for work and has a nice smooth and joyful ride to ride, then works on the important and not urgent things, works on emergencies if needed, delegates quad 3 activities, and rejects quad 4 tasks. Joe takes a nice relaxing lunch and thinks about the rest of his day and plan his night. At the end of the work day he closes out tasks and plans things for the next day. He gets home and prepares a healthy meal and then maybe reads before bed. He seems to have more time to think about his life, reflects on things, and makes plans on where he want to end up and who he wants to be (habit 2). Huge difference, right?
 
The first 3 habits (be proactive, begin with the end in mind, and put first things first) are about moving you from being dependent to being independent. They are about self mastery. They help you become more effective as an individual by developing inner strength, character, purpose, and values.
 
The next 3 habits move you from being independent to being interdependent. Interdependence is the highest level level of what Stephen Covey calls the maturity continuum. The maturity continuum consists of 3 levels: dependence, independence, and interdependence.

*No matter your achievements, there is always room to improve. Enjoy this book summary of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, which offers the following seven profound solutions to reach toward your full potential.*
 
The first habit that Stephen Covey discusses is being proactive. What distinguishes us as humans from all other animals is our inherent ability to examine our own character, to decide how to view ourselves and our situations, and to control our own effectiveness.
 
It is comfortable and convenient to blame your genes, or the economy for your troubles. In any case, you are the only one who is responsible for your current condition. No matter your situation there is always at-least one choice you can make to live a better life: You can choose how any situation affects you.
 
This includes a commitment to self-improvement and, by extension, personal growth. By setting small goals and sticking to them, you gradually increase your integrity, which increases your ability to take responsibility for your life.
 
The author recommends that as much as you think about your life goals, you also think about who you want to be. When you have that clear, you can draft principles and values in accordance with that person.
 
This is a factWith your principles and values clear you will approach life and all the events in your life with a high level of clarity and confidence. Stephen Covey emphasizes that our self-awareness empowers us to shape our own lives, instead of living our lives by default or based on the standards or preferences of others.
 
This is a factDeveloping this mission statement should take time. And, it should also be to the point. So, lubricate and impregnate your future with good by making sure your mission statement centers around your values, and the fundamental principals mentioned previously.
 
As you know where you want to go and how you want to be, you make sure that what you do aligns with those things. With the destination in mind you automatically go in the right direction so that each day contributes meaningfully to what you want in life.
 
Your integrity is synonymous with how much you value yourself and how well you keep your commitments. Habit three concerns itself with prioritizing these commitments and putting the most important things first.
 
This is a factDo not let the illusion of busyness fool you into believing you are effective. To be truly effective, you must focus on your long term goals (found in your mission statement) for the future.
 
When we are emotionally dependent on other people, then our own self worth hinges on their approval. Independence is the next step up, and this is a very popular message in our society today. Interdependence, which means having a life that is interwoven with others, but not being dependent on them, is creating win/win agreements.
 
This is a factIn most difficult situations, the problem is the system, not the people. By approaching those situations with the question of how we can change the system to make it work for all involved, many difficult problems can be resolved.
 
By proactively making deposits, you ensure that the emotional funds will be there when the time comes to make a withdrawal. Trust is essential to achieving win/win agreements. You must nourish your relationships to maintain a high level of trust.
 
This is a factNeeds stop motivating people once those needs are satisfied. Satisfy the need to be understood, and you can move on to being productive. Subsequently, the other half of this habit is being understood.
 
Crisis negotiators at the FBI use similar techniques. In his book, Never Split the Difference, Chris Voss shares some of the most effective negotiation techniques he used with criminals, kidnappers, and then later in his business and personal life.
 
Start to live at a higher level by putting the first five habits into practice and adding authenticity and openness. To operate at this level consistently, you can become more effective than most people can dream of being.
 
To be effective, we must devote the time to renewing ourselves physically, spiritually, mentally, and socially. Continuous renewal allows us to synerg
