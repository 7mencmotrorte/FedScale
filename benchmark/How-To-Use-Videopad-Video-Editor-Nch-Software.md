**VideoPad Video Editor** (or simply **VideoPad**) is a video editing application developed by NCH Software. It is complemented by the VirtualDub plug-ins that work with the software.[2][3][4][5] VideoPad integrates WavePad, a sound-editing program;[6] MixPad, a sound-mixing program;[7] and PhotoPad, an image editor.[8]

VideoPad supports frequently used file formats[9] including Audio Video Interleave (AVI), Windows Media Video (WMV), 3GP, and DivX.[10] It supports direct video uploads to YouTube, Flickr, and Facebook.[3]

VideoPad uses two screens: the first for a preliminary review of chosen video and audio snippets and the second to review the entire track. The application supports several video effects, including those involving light, color, transitions, and text.[11]

VideoPad is presumably trialware. The free edition is feature-limited, in particular only AVI and WMV export is supported, while the non-free version has more advanced features.[12] VideoPad Master Edition supports plugins while the free version does not. The non-free edition does not limit simultaneous video tracks, but the free one allows at most two concurrent tracks and limits export file type options after the trial period expires.[4] VideoPad is also available on Steam.[13]

*Redding Record Searchlight* columnist Andrea Eldridge wrote in 2012 that the "easy-to-use VideoPad brings advanced features to the beginner".[5] She said that VideoPad has a voice-over feature Windows Movie Maker did not have. The feature allows users to either record their own narration or upload existing recordings.[5] Softonic.com said VideoPad was "simple" and "easy to use" but noted that "more advanced users will definitely find it too basic" and lamented that the program had "only three [transitions]".[11] Danny Chadwick of Top Ten Reviews rated VideoPad a 6.15/10. He said the application was "great for beginners" but that it lacked "many of the transitions or extras that are standard in similar applications".[3] Maximum PC contributor Ben Kim stated in 2014 that "VideoPad is easily the best free video editor available." Kim wrote that VideoPad is "a stellar editor that manages to pack an almost obscene number of features into a surprisingly digestible package".[15]

Someone has asked how to make video slideshow to share on YouTube, using PowerPoint. Yes, you can use PowerPoint to make that slideshow and then upload to YouTube, but the effects embedded in Microsoft PowerPoint is so lame compare to professional video editors. So you should further edit your PowerPoint slideshow with a video editor if you want it to be popular on YouTube.

**PowerPoint to VideoPad Editor Converter**
Convert PowerPoint to VideoPad Editor video easily so you can import PowerPoint presentations to VideoPad Editor for further editing and sharing on YouTube and more.

The export functions are extensive, too. Burn your finished videos to DVD, save them to your hard drive in one of several available formats or share them directly to YouTube or Facebook. There are also compatible presets available for selected smartphones and mobile video players.

The latest version of VideoPad Video Editor features several enhancements to the 360-degree video mode, including the ability to add a 2D video or picture to a 360-degree compilation, and a scale parameter for the 360-degree effect. See the release notes for full details.

In the past, we have referred to VideoPad as free software, and NCH advertises its free version of VideoPad for home use. However, certain features are known to time out even in the free version, and users have complained over the years about features not working even though their use was non-commercial.

With this VideoPad review, we tested the paid licensed version, but we recommend that you try the free version before you buy. Note that if you do continue to use the free version, the Mac app will ask you to verify that every time you launch it, which gets a bit old.

With VideoPad, enough is never too much. It does not provide an overabundance of choices, but offers a respectable selection of transitional effects for moving between clips and images and a collection of filters to give them a unique look. Other helpful features include the ability to edit 360 video, as well as video stabilization.

VideoPad lets users enhance their videos with transitions, visual effects, overlays, and text. It also provides some rudimentary audio tools and lets you select from an extensive library of sound effects and background atmospheric audio.

Numerous optimization features let you fine-tune colors, add digital images to footage, add subtitles, and adjust the speed of video playback. Its video stabilization feature lets you reduce the camera shake, while the high-end version supports special effects plugins
