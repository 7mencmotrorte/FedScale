I found out the problem, in my case I use Rider from Jetbrains as IDE, and when I asked to install the **RiderLink plugin** I installed it in the Engine, and not in the project, and as it is still in early access, Rider is also having some bugs and when I install this plugin in the Engine, it returns these errors.
