Most of this seems pretty obvious to me: NORM gives you the PFD (Pilot Flight Display with attitude, altitude, speed, etc. indicators) on the outboard DU and the navigational display on the inboard DU; and the three INBD settings change the inboard display to show the engine primary display (normally on the centre console upper panel), PFD, or multi-function display (normally on the centre console lower panel).
 
It blanks the inboard display & forces the PFD to its normal place. It would take a combination of failures for this to be needed, but if the system sensed the wrong display as having failed & was trying to put the PFD on the inboard (actually failed) screen, then this would get it back to the (actually working) outboard screen. A really, really unlikely case.
 
The overhead panel is the nerve center of the aircraft systems and replaces many of the controls previously located on the flight engineers panel. the following page shows how the function and layout of this important panel has evolved from its roots in the 1950's.
 
The individual panels are usually partially covered by a 1/4in deep raised section called the light plate. This contains the backlights for any markings required for the panel. The small white cross on each light-plate shows the position of the electrical connector behind the plate. So, if the individual panel lighting is acting up then pressing on the cross will sometimes help.

This night shot of a 737-700 overhead panel illustrates the "Dark cockpit" concept which is that if all is well, then no captioned lights should be illuminated. Unfortunately Boeing still designed the NG with the window heat ON lights blazing away for the entire duration of every flight, which is why we have to replace them so often! The effect is also spoilt by the Gen Panel LED's
 
Although difficult to identify all of the controls in this low shot photograph, It can still be seen how the 727-200 panel bridges the gap between 707 and 737, in particular, the Flight Controls panel is very recognisable to 737 pilots.
 
This 707-441 overhead panel shows some components that are still in use on the 737 of today. For instance, the HF radios, alternate flap, emergency exit lights, rain repellent, and exterior lights are virtually identical. All credit to Boeing for living by the theory of: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
 
I also know almost nothing about this. Assuming it comes with a USB connector, I'd guess you'll have to assign actions to each of the switches and knobs in the settings. A bit like the way you'd 'map' a keyboard key to an action.
 
Try these Scripts, its for both the TQ and Engine start panel, extract to xlua in zibo plugins, i dont have these hardware so i cant verify if they still works but i guess it doesnt hurt to try it out.
 
Well today I received my overhead panel from Andi and boy is it beautiful. Unfortunately UPS stomped on the crate and broke the darn thing. The good thing is Andi is doing everything in his power to contact UPS and get them to cover it.
 
The scripts from j9murphy will work correctly with the flightsimpm throttles and lights/start panel. There is an old thread that gives much information on the installation. As far as I know no one has written any script for the OH panel you have to run with the Zibo. I doubt you will get any luck with the FDS scripts as they are for different hardware fitted with different IO cards.
 
The hardware from FlightDeckSolutions is plug and play for the Zibo mod as Pikitanga and friends have done a superb job in writing the scripts required. I have just installed the FDS MCP and captains EFIS and was amazed it worked out of the box without drama. Without coding experience you have 2 choices. The first is to learn programming yourself, a long and lonely process, which is a hobby in itself. The second is to ensure the product will work properly with your rig before you buy. I made this mistake before and beware the phrase 'XP11 compatible' - that only means it will work IF you have the necessary software. Small hardware manufacturers of a very niche market don't have the time or expertise to supply the software for every conceivable simulator program and provide support...
 
Is it possible to get a copy of the script file to the flightsimpm overhead panel that work with 737 zibo from You? I have the small overhead panel V2 and the gear lever from flightsimpm. It's brand new have not installed it yet, have no clue maki
 
Thanks for al this info and the lua scipt but i hava no idea how to inplement it in the lua scipt et.  
I wrote down some button codes but the next step is for me????? Where and how hanle this?  
Any help is appriciated.
 
Tried using SPAD.NEXT again with no luck. I was able to attach the function to the buttons in SPAD.NEXT, but this would not translate into the sim. Began to think that a USB-C cable might be required, however, I am yet to try this. Two emails to FlightSImPM have gone unanswered. So I'm stumped. $600.00AUD down there drain!!!
 
I am sure that I was able to switch each radio panel on or off, but although the pointing finger/hand appear when IO hover over the switch, it will no longer switch on or off. I found it useful to switch panel 1 off when trying to listen to the Atis on panel 2
 
Also, yesterday I was instructed to fly direct to a waypoint. On the Zibo FMC there is no Direct button, but the usual way is to click on the instructed waypoint and then click on the second (non purple) waypoint side button to substitute it. Problem was it was already too late to do that, so I tried to substitute it to replace the purple highlighted next waypoint, but it said it was not valid, so I was unable to comply.
 
Sorry but I do not understand the reply for VHF. There are only 2 radio panels, side by side with Squawk & other stuff between. The PNL OFF button always used to work on each side and it could toggle the whole side on or off, which is what I am trying to achieve.
 
Hi all. I'm looking at this product and have successfully got it up and running and connected to MSFS. I am puzzled about night lighting though as no matter what I do I can't get it to look like the PMDG 737 overhead. in the demo clicking the screw above circuit breaker does display a less bright screen but it's not illuminated correctly and turning the dials in the sim has no effect - the knobs do work though as I can see actions in the avia overhead. Is this a limitation of the demo or the actual product, I have searched for videos and images of the product in use and not found much but what I have found doesn't show the overhead lit up as it should be at night. Thanks
 
-now, if night mode is active, there are different light modes: the dome light, which is the three-way switch. It's basically a flood light that behaves like in the sim. This switch position is synchronized with the simulator.
 
- then there is the round dial that controls the backlighting. Contrary to the sim, this is modeled as an incremental switch as the SDK is missing the actual position of the dial. As such, I have no data as to what it is set in the sim. But manipulating this dial on the remote overhead will control both the backlighting of the remote overhead as well as the sim's overhead. You can turn it to full bright by double clicking on the right side of it, similar to what you can do in the sim itself.
 
Thanks for the info, so to clarify, when I move the dome light switch in the sim I do see the brightness change in the Avia overhead. For the reason you've explained, when I turn the panel light knob in the sim nothing happens in the Avia o/h cause of the sdk limitation. Because I'm just running the demo I can't turn the knob in the avia o/h but in the full version turning this up would bring up the orange backlighting as seen in the sim overhead panel. If that's right then I'm tempted to purchase!
 
Hi. Well I'm still hoping that Just Flight will be feeling charitable and either refund my money or at least give me a credit note. I know it was my own stupid mistake but it was a genuine one and I haven't activated the code I was given. Fingers crossed...
 
I've spent ages going backwards and forwards in my head whether I could justify the cost of a full size OH from CPFlight or some similar company, in the end I opted for a compromise and picked up a 32" touchscreen monitor off Ebay. It works like a charm. This week I spent making a surround panel so it looks less like a large monitor hanging above me and something that looks a little more at home in a cockpit.
 
No, no hit at all, because the monitor runs separate from MSFS. You only experience a performance hit if the virtual screen is shared across to another monitor, such as creating a second cockpit view or dragging a pop out instrument across.
